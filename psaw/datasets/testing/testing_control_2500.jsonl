{"id": "eh8nji", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seniorkitties/comments/eh8nji/tough_situation_with_elderly_19_yo_kittie/", "title": "Tough situation with elderly (19 yo) kittie", "author": "makeupaddikt08", "selftext": "As the title states, I'm in a tough spot with our 19 year old female kittie.\n\nTL;dr - My girl is so old and struggling but I cannot suggest to my husband that she be put down because I'd feel like a monster and it would break him. I just need to vent. I don't know what to do. \n\nNikita is a beautiful girl who was my husband's cat before we were together. He has had her since he was 19 years old himself. She has had a good life and once I came into the picture 9 years ago, I mainly took over her care. Nikita has been a bit of a curmudgeon her entire life, but overall a loving girl and always happy to accept changes with new cats, moving and more. \n\nAfter our move into our home last year, Nikita went downhill quickly. We knew navigating the stairs was no longer an option for her, as she has lost sight and some mobility due to age. I set her up near the laundry room where we began keeping a litter box for her. She has her own little area with her heated bed, where she spends a majority of her time, and her own water fountain (she loves running water), and her food. In the past year Nikita's mobility has decreased and the vet feels like she has suffered several mini strokes. Her sight is all but gone now but she can still hear a little bit and knows her area well. She still eats and drinks. But she continues to decline. Her mini strokes and resulting neurological issues have caused her mobility to further decline. She doesn't groom as well as she used to, so of course I brush her daily and wipe up her face and bottom for her. I'm currently trying to figure out how to trim her nails so they won't continue to get hung up on things, which can cause her to fall. Nikita is a constant fall risk due to instability. When her nails get hung on a rug or pad (low to no pile and minimum floor coverings) she has a tendency to get anxious and fall. As of 2 months ago she began having issues finding the litter pan. She would get in the area, smell the litter, and then relieve herself. Thankfully on tile floors, but it can take an hour or more of cleaning and steaming to remedy the issue and not let the urine ruin the floors. We went to a modified litter pan with lower sides, which helped momentarily but the issue has just gotten worse. \n\nI've spoken with my husband about Nikita ad nauseam. I know he loves her. I do too. But watching her struggle so hard is really taxing emotionally. Taking care of her has been daunting some days and I am carrying a majority of the load because he works so much. I don't mind being a cat nurse, but just watching the decline and making sure she eats, makes it to the potty, cleaning her, cleaning up after her...it is a lot when I handle so much as it is. This morning I spent over an hour cleaning up after her, washing her down, I've done two loads of laundry (bed pads, her blankie, rugs, towels), and making sure the floor is properly cleaned. I'm personally at the end of my rope with her care, as horrible as I feel for saying that. I've explained the issue and my feelings to my husband. His response has been to check the litter box area before work daily and that's about it. He visually scans the area and says everything looks clean. I go to do checks an hour later and find the exact opposite, as I get down and check the output (make sure she is still toileting), feel around the pads and plastic I've had to start putting down, etc. Then I start with the almost daily cleaning process. \n\nI cannot tell my husband to let her go humanely. It just doesn't sit well with me. When I last met with the vet, he is of the opinion that while she has struggles, she still eats and drinks and uses the bathroom so leave her be until her time comes. That's how I feel as well, but holy shit...this is difficult and it actually affects my marriage, as I don't feel like my husband is listening to me and he feels sad and overwhelmed by the prospect of having to have his old girl sent over the rainbow bridge. \n\nI don't know what to do and just needed to vent. Any advice or helpful or encouraging words are appreciated. Having a pet is so wonderful and life changing, but also heartbreaking.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:31:32+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:31:33+00:00", "subreddit": "seniorkitties", "subreddit_id": "t5_31m29", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.seniorkitties", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/seniorkitties/comments/eh8nji/tough_situation_with_elderly_19_yo_kittie/"}

I read tons and tons of things from Monash and other websites, including this sub. I'm in the process of making a daily schedule of meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) containing dishes comprised of foods I can eat, taken from the app (Green circle only servings)\n\nBut I'm having a hard time understanding something. It might be stupid but.. wanted to check first with someone:\n\nAccording to Monash Website, Phase 1 says that:\n\n&gt; During this phase you would use the Monash University Low FODMAP Diet App to choose\nfoods with a \u2018green\u2019 serving size. This means that you only eat foods in a low FODMAP serve.\n\nThis confuses me a bit. For instance, regarding fruits, these are some I like and the servings are FODMAP safe according to the App:\n\n- Banana (100g)\n- Orange (130g)\n- Pineapple (140g)\n\nSo, this means that I can eat all of the above fruits on a day, as long as I stay in the safe amount of each?\n\nI already went to a dietitian and she made me my \"diet\", which is supposed to cover all portions of the food pyramid. The problem is that it was not made to be FODMAP \"Friendly\". So, I was thinking I could just re-use her list but swap the ingredients with FODMAP ones, respecting the safe serving size. That way I'm eating all my body needs and being on a FODMAP safe side.\n\nDoes this make sense? Sorry if this is stupid again.. I'm just SO done with feeling bad with IBS and now is the first time I'm actually optimistic that things will improve.\n\nThank you!", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:31:29+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:31:31+00:00", "subreddit": "FODMAPS", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sxvy", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.FODMAPS", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 14, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/FODMAPS/comments/eh8nis/help_to_start_diet_with_monash_app/"}

I'll keep this as brief as possible to avoid annoying people, I've done quite enough of that in my time here. \ud83d\ude1d\n\nDiscord Moderation  has always been a problem for me. Its an issue I've spoken with Duck about before and I hope it's something he can clean up. Geordie mentions members feeling forced out, well seeing first hand several members feel forced out aided and abetted by well respected members of the speakership team and moderation team is a bit of a kick in the teeth. Especially as I'm not convinced the members of the speakership / moderation team involved really understand what they did to members.\n\nDealing with the events team was at time like pulling teeth. In govt I\u2019d get commitments on things from one member of the events team and on the other side I\u2019d be told something different.  Commitments would be made then unmade, and to this day I\u2019m convinced the decision to release the trump-me discord conversations was done purely to cause trouble for the govt by someone who was not exactly favourable to the then govt who had the power to cause trouble. No subsequent explanation ever changed my view on that. With partisans on the events team, it\u2019ll never have the confidence of members on the other side.\n\nFinally, I think the community needs to do more to spot the signs of those with mental health issues and take action. There are some who caused considerable, considerable, distress to some members of this community and put people in situations nobody should have to go through. The Quad and co would do well to remember a moto they have often used themselves, that there is a person behind the screen. \n\nThis is all quite negative but MHoC is a good thing and enjoyable a lot of the time. Don't let this take away from that.\n\nI can't say im sad to be retiring (from the front line) but I may make the odd speech on interesting stuff. To those who've I've invariably annoyed over the few years I\u2019ve been here I'm sorry and I bare you no Ill will. To the many good people I've met here keep having fun and I hope this is not goodbye forever. \ud83d\ude04 And to those of you (and you know who you are) who through your kindness and friendship and listening to me vent and offering advice saved me from some dark places this year, I'm so grateful and always will be.

Super problematic, as people way younger than me are so fond of saying.But the cool thing about the dirtier parts of Reddit is that I can be honest and don\u2019t have to self censor like I do in my day day to day.Plus, I just can\u2019t help the features and qualities I find super attractive.\r\n\r\nUp front, there are some fantasies and forms of play that I\u2019m just not into. I\u2019m not into what apparently constitutes \u201crace play\u201d as that apparently involves slurs, meanness, and other dark shit. That\u2019s just not me. If it\u2019s your thing, cool, but I\u2019m too appreciative and playful for that sort of thing. I\u2019m a huge perv, but not a dark perv if that makes any sense.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also not really the role play type. I want to know you and what gets you going. I want to hear your fantasies. Especially the deep down fantasies you\u2019re keep super guarded. I don\u2019t want to have to type out impromptu erotic fiction.\r\n\r\nSo what am I into when it comes to interracial fantasies? Pretty much all non mean fun, but I love fantasies that reject cliches and deconstruct and rearrange the typical.

Noticed what sounded like one cylinder not firing at 100%. Pulled each plug coil but could not identify the jug with problems. Going to start with a compression test, but what could be happening?

And I think I'd like to give photography another try. \n\nThat's why I would like to find references, would you please help me? :)", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:31:05+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:31:07+00:00", "subreddit": "photography", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2a", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.photography", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/photography/comments/eh8naw/do_you_guys_have_some_menthorreferent_that_made/"}

If I am given the opportunity to live again I will still choose you as my mum and our family will still be my place of birth.\n\nBut unfortunately, I know that there is not going to be any such opportunity. Mum, I didn\u2019t want to do this, but I was compelled by circumstances beyond my control to take the plunge.\n\nI tried my best to pull through, but my best was not good enough. I battled alone for about thirteen months now until my strength failed me. You and dad could not decipher what I was going through and maybe I should not blame you for that.\n\nMy one and only brother came very close to understanding what I was passing through but it was too much for his young mind to comprehend.\n\nMum, I know that you and dad loved me and did everything you could to prove that to me but I was not feeling loved. You provided for me more than I even wanted, took me to places that most of my mates have not even heard of, yet despite all these my heart was longing for love.\n\nI needed someone who would love me for who I was. I needed someone who could reach to the depth of my soul and feel the vacuum there. The material provisions you spoiled me with could not do that. And I was alone all the while, despite the fact that we laughed together and had gist as a family.\n\nThen came the last straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Your brother, Uncle Tony who came to live with us, made me to believe that he knew exactly what my soul was longing for \u2013 companionship.\n\nHe chose to stay with me when you and dad were too busy to notice my loneliness. He tried to keep me company when I needed someone to talk to but had only gadgets and teddy bears as my company. I was fooled to trust him and he hacked into my foolishness. And he did it perfectly and deeply.\n\nMum, your brother raped me and used me as sex toy for three whole years. I expected you or dad to notice but none of you did.\n\nWhen he left our house last year I was shattered because I have grown to fill the void of your presence with his dirty deeds. I couldn\u2019t complain because I was afraid to lose him, but when he eventually left for Canada the magnitude of the emptiness in me became too heavy for me to carry.\n\nI struggled to forget those experiences but I could not. My grades dropped in school and you and dad quickly arranged for a home lesson teacher. Mum, that singular act instead of helping me fueled what is about to happen to me a few minutes from now.\n\nThe home lesson teacher you brought so much reminded me of Uncle Tony and, on several occasions, I felt like grabbing him and making him to fill the gap that Tony\u2019s absence created in me. Mum, I had to do this because I was lonely.\n\nDid you ever imagine what I was doing in my room all the time I stayed there alone? Couldn\u2019t you for once have gone out of your way to just spend some time with me so that we could talk?\n\nThere are many things I would have liked to tell you but I don\u2019t want to add to your pain so let those other torments be buried with this undignified body of mine.\n\nPlease make sure that my brother David doesn\u2019t get to the point where I am now. Also, tell your friends and colleagues who have children to find out what is happening with their beloved kids before it gets too late.\n\nMany of the things parents do in the name of showing love are not what we the younger ones need. I would have gone, long hours before you will get to read this note.\n\nBut one cheering thing is that David is still there with you. Transfer the love you had for me to him.\n\nMy bank details and the passwords to my phones and laptops are all in the piece of paper I dropped in the drawer of your dressing table.\n\nI miss you and it pains to empty the content of this bottle in my hand into my mouth but I am constrained to do it all the same. Tell dad and David that I love them. Tell our pastor that I will miss his sermons and long prayers. Tell my friends not to envy me.\n\nGoodbye mum.\u201d\n\nThat was the suicide note a 16-year old girl dropped for her mother before taking her life. Who is to be blamed ?\n\nYou may save someone's life if you pass this story to all on your social media.\n\nLessons\n\n1. Parents, do you find yourself to be \u201ctoo\u201d busy and tired to be in the present moment with your children? Are you more invested in your job and house duties than spending time with your kids? \n\n2. Let your child know they are loved for who they are, and that you are always there to support them.\n\n3. For the past few weeks, the social media has been awashed with many suicide stories on the pages of the media. Many more may still come.\n\n4. Be a supportive parent and actively listen without judgment and seeking to understand their concerns and challenges. Being a supportive parent means having your child\u2019s best interests at heart but also being present, involved and helpful. \n\n5. Treat your child fairly and develop a trusting relationship.\n\n6. Always acknowledge your child's achievements and supporting them through mistakes and challenges.\n\n7. Parents, let's ALWAYS be there for our children in the way that we would have wanted our parents to be there for us. \n\nIntentional parenting is what the kids of today's generation need. May we become the kind of parents that they need.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:31:04+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:31:04+00:00", "subreddit": "ofcoursethatsathing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xgrs", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.ofcoursethatsathing", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ofcoursethatsathing/comments/eh8naa/be_she_died_she_said_this/"}

I Do and Every Guy I Tell Thinks I\u2019m Weird", "author": "throwaway78946298", "selftext": "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever liked it, even as a young teen. When I was younger I used porn just to see nude women, but then I learned to just watch masturbation videos instead of any sex videos. I\u2019ll be corny and say it, it is beyond degrading and 100% of my pleasure comes from my partners pleasure, whether it\u2019s just a hook up or a serious partner, so I can\u2019t enjoy porn knowing the videos are so fake and no woman would actually enjoy what\u2019s going on, especially the actor who\u2019s probably drier than a desert, chaffing and getting railed for the 10time that day. There\u2019s always exceptions though and I do know that some women would actually love that kind of sex\n\nI almost think it\u2019s ruining, if it already hasn\u2019t, a whole generation of young men at no fault of their own. Porn is how young boys learn sex now and it\u2019s become accepted. Me and my friends are on completely different ends of the sex spectrum (let\u2019s pretend that\u2019s actually a thing). They are all into porn style sex and were basically raised by porn, I never got into porn enough and I hate that kind of sex. We\u2019re a very open group of friends and I\u2019ve seen videos my friends have taken with girls and it looks like they are trying to make it a porno and the girl looks like she is hating it or acting for her life to make it look like she is enjoying it and all my friends are like \u201cmaaaaan you gave it to her good bro look how much that b*tch was loving it\u201d I blame the way they talk on a mix of porn and the music industry/social media. So much for respecting the woman who just got naked for you, opened her self up to you, made you feel like a king and made you cum.\n\nToo me it just seems like porn teaches boys the opposite of everything a woman wants. Like I said, some still like a good ol rough and sloppy porno fuck though. Before I continue I\u2019ve tried to find different ways of saying this so I don\u2019t sound full of myself or like a douche, but I am NOT that good at sex yet I\u2019ve had many partners and many call backs, and currently at university, I actually have a waiting list of women to sleep with and the great majority of my past partners liked the exact opposite of what porn shows. Some of them even thought that\u2019s what they liked and then were shocked by me doing things a different way. I find women go crazy for soft and slow sex. Even the ones who think they wanted it harder and faster. I mean you\u2019re dealing with extremely sensitive, delicate intimate areas of the body, kind of makes sense it should be a little slow and gentle.\n\nI\u2019d say this affects women more really. Men are still cumming, the women aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a whole generation of women now who think sex is something simply done to them, not something to be done together with someone and enjoyed. Guys always seem to get off over how much pain a girl can take during sex ie: the new popular saying \u201ctaking dick\u201d. A female friend even told me a story where she went home with a guy, he closed the door, kissed her once, threw her on the couch, ripped her pants and rammed his dick inside her and she thought he just ripped apart the entire inside of her vagina and this guy had a penis the size of her forearm so he should really know better. The perspective of porn is from the men\u2019s view so obviously it\u2019s only going to show the stuff guys want, and this is how boys are learning sex, by watching other guys get everything they want.\n\nThere\u2019s this awful mentality in hook up culture now that you\u2019re only their to get what you want. You dance with someone for a while, go back home together and cum and then you go home and then she slams you for being bad in bed and he just says \u201coh well still fucked\u201d. I see it all the time. What happened to enjoying each other. Dance until the bar closes, go somewhere and get a drunk meal, talk afterwards, actually try and meet the girl and then make her cum. You will not make her cum through penetration unless you rub her clit at the same time, so either do that or do your job first before you put it in.\n\nHopefully someone agrees with me because I feel a little crazy right now, no one I\u2019ve talked to has agreed. Some will at least agree boys are taught through porn but no guy agrees that porn is ruining sex. I just imagine how good it probably was before porn.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:31:01+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:31:02+00:00", "subreddit": "sex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.sex", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/sex/comments/eh8n9j/m19_any_other_guys_hate_porn_for_a_lot_of_reason/"}

{"id": "eh8n7g", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/eh8n7g/my_surgical_story_6w6d_positive/", "title": "My surgical story- 6w6d; positive", "author": "an0n90", "selftext": "This is my first time posting, but I read almost every post in this community while making my decision to have an abortion, and hope I can help someone in the way the other stories helped me. This will be very long, I\u2019m trying to put in as much detail as possible. If anyone has any questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them. \n\nI found out I was pregnant December 15th, and estimated I was about 6 weeks along. I made an appointment with my gyno and saw her December 20th. I had my abortion December 27th. \n\nI decided to take a pregnancy test because my period was 2 weeks late. I was not using birth control, my fianc\u00e9 and I sporadically use condoms, and he pulls out every time. We have been together going on 10 years, and I thought this was a safe pattern for us. On top of that, I had a doctor tell me in early puberty I may have challenges getting pregnant due to an angling of my uterus. I don\u2019t know what went differently this time, but I had a gut feeling I was pregnant, so I got a cvs test and within 5 seconds of peeing on it, it showed positive for pregnancy. \n\nI had taken the test at 5am (wanted it to be the first pee of the day) and so after seeing the result, I climbed back in bed, took a deep breath and told my fianc\u00e9. He was shocked, and then quickly started laughing, and asking if we were just going to have a little guy running around our apartment in 9 months. \n\nHis attitude made me feel so much better about the situation, and I started imagining us with a baby. I fluctuated between excitement and fear. I am 29 and he is 32, we have a high income, and live in a 1 bedroom apartment in a major city. I felt even though we had the infrastructure for a family, we didn\u2019t have the liquid savings, a car, space, or proximity to our families.  We knew for it to work, we would have to make some changes. We started looking at houses that are within commuting distance. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s support was unwavering from the moment I told him. \n\nI made my first prenatal appointment and he came with me, held my hand through a Pap smear and then the ultrasound after. My doctor asked if we would carry full term and I told her I wanted to better understand my options, since this wasn\u2019t planned. She told me abortions are very safe, she could do it there in the office if that was what I wanted. She told me she herself had had children and she had had abortions, and no matter what decision I made, to not look back. \n\nWhen I saw the ultrasound, I looked at my fianc\u00e9. I was expecting to see something that made me feel maternal. Instead I saw a black hole with a small sack and a smaller speck inside of it. The tech told me I was about 6 weeks along. \n\nI asked to speak to the doctor again, and since she was busy, we were able to meet with her medical assistant. I had a bunch of questions about abortion, and while she was answering, I became very emotional and burst out crying. I was crying because I was overwhelmed and never expected to be in this situation. I asked when the due date was- 2 weeks before our wedding date. \n\nWhen we got home, I collapsed in the hallway sobbing. He picked me up, hugged me until I could breathe again, and told me how proud he was of me, how strong I was being, and how grateful he was to have me as his partner. He told me he couldn\u2019t wait to marry me, and whatever I wanted to do, he would be thrilled with. He said that keeping it or terminating it were both positive options for us, and we would have an amazing life together no matter which I chose. \n\nI asked him repeatedly to tell me which he preferred, and he only told me he would be happy and supportive either way. I eventually told him I was leaning towards abortion bc I didn\u2019t feel ready, I wanted to plan the pregnancy, I wanted a car and a house (or bigger apt) and I wanted to be happy/ excited when I got pregnant. He told me he agreed, and was also leaning towards abortion, but that if I changed my mind he would be behind me 100%. I called and made an abortion appointment at PP for Dec 27, since my doctor wasn\u2019t available until the new year, and I didn\u2019t want to wait.\n\nThe next week we went for Christmas with my family. I had the flu, and was able to hide my extreme pregnancy fatigue, but it was difficult. I did not have any morning sickness, but I did get nauseated towards the end of the day every day, and very tired. I also had a high fever, so all in all it wasn\u2019t a great holiday. I had cramping constantly, and started imagining the pregnancy as a uterus full of burrs. I felt like there was something foreign in me that I wanted out.\n\nEventually the morning of the 27th came. I had an 8:10 apt and got there at 7:45. I was the first person in the waiting room, and as other women and their support people filled the room, a nurse came back to gather the patients. I hugged my fianc\u00e9 goodbye and went into the medical facility to check in. \n\nOnce I was checked in, I went to a different floor where they called me for an ultrasound. I started crying before she even asked me if I wanted to see the image. I did want to, and she told me I was 6 weeks 6 days. I felt the same way I had at the other ultrasound appointment - I felt no attachment to this pregnancy. \n\nAfter I went back to the waiting room I was called by a medical assistant to do blood work. I started crying again when she asked me if it was my first pregnancy (yes) and she offered me to speak to a counselor. I said no, started crying harder, she offered again and I said yes.\n\nThe counselor was AMAZING. She made the entire experience manageable. I spoke with her for almost 2 hours (mostly bc there was no one else waiting to see her, so she had me do my blood work in her office, got the results and interpreted them with me there). She explained in detail the process, which was similar to what many women explained in their posts as well. Because I was so early in the pregnancy, I did not need any kind of dilation of my cervix. She told me the procedure would take 2-5 minutes, it is 14x safer than childbirth and that no one had ever died  or had a serious complication from the procedure in the entire history of that facility. She told me that with my medical history and my early stage, I had a .5% chance of anything going wrong, and even in that rare case, there was a hospital down the street they would send me to. \n\nI spoke with her extensively about sedation. When I made the initial appointment it was for mild sedation. I called the night before my appointment and changed it to moderate (and arranged to go to a different center that offered moderate; I was very lucky I could get an appointment the same day and time as my original at the new location). By the time I left her office, I had decided on full sedation, being put to sleep. For me, this decision was made out of fear of pain, and of being aware of the procedure. I did not want to know what was happening. She told me she would come down during my procedure and hold my hand the entire time, even while I was asleep, if that\u2019s what I wanted. \n\nAfter leaving her office, I was no longer crying, I felt confident in my decision and understood what was going to happen. I sat in a waiting area with about 20 other girls of all ages and races waiting for the same procedure I was having. The counselor told me they average 60 abortions a day. The day that I was there, they were doing 47, which was a slow day.\n\nWhen I was called back for the procedure, I walked into an operating room, changed into a gown, and laid down on the table with stirrups. The doctor, nurse and anesthesiologist all introduced themselves. The second I put my legs up, I started hysterically crying out of fear. The doctor that would do the operation came over to me and held my hand. She told me I would be fine, she asked if this was my decision, and she said it was her job to make sure I was safe. I asked the anesthesiologist multiple times if I would wake up.  She told me I absolutely would, and that everyone would make me comfortable. The doctor told me to squeeze her hand as hard as I had to until I fell asleep. As I fell asleep I told them my face was going numb and they said that was normal. The doctor looked me directly in they eyes as I went under and told me to think of a warm beach with her. The last thing I remember was thinking she must be exactly my age. \n\nI woke up in the recovery room with no pain. I asked the nurse who gave me antibiotics if it was over. I asked her 3 times because I didn\u2019t believe her. The curtains around my recovery chair were open and I could see into the operating room I had just been in. I could see the patient that went in after me, knocked out on the same table I had been on. I saw the same doctor and anesthesiologist working on her. I started crying again, out of relief and gratitude. I saw the anesthesiologist come over after helping the nurse wheel the patient out and before the next one came in, I asked to speak with her. I told her she changed my life, and I could never thank her enough. She told me she was so glad she could be there for me, and would tell the doctor what I had said. \n\nI ate some crackers and had apple juice. A nurse looked at my pad (no blood at all) and told me I could go when I wanted. I ate another cracker and got up and left. The nurse who brought me to my fianc\u00e9 asked me what I was going to eat later. I told her Mac and cheese. \n\nI took an Uber home and was back in bed with a heating pad by 1:45. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 48 hours now since I got home from the procedure. I have had mild cramping, about a 3/10. I have not bled at all. I don\u2019t know if I will at all. I read it\u2019s normal to not bleed, and normal to bleed after a few days. \n\nI am immensely happy with my decision and the procedure itself. I was terrified of every step along the way, and for me, that impacted my sedation decision. I am very pleased I went with full. I have been in almost no pain, and I feel lucky for that. \n\nWhile writing my experiences here, I cried for the first time since leaving the clinic.

The appraiser gave us a long, tedious list things that need to be repaired and in many ways feels outside their purview. Things like raking leaves and removing mold from bricks outside the house.  The price is at asking/ offer though. The appraiser was so over the top that they've made the listing agent and seller hesitant. I'm fairly certain the seller won't want to pay for repairs but we still want to buy the home because it's a good neighborhood and house.

Since then, whenever I take any antibiotic (AFAIK) I get swelling in either arm pits. It was the first time such swelling occurred on my body ever. I don't remember if I ever had doxycycline before that, as I never cared. Doxycycline gave strongest reaction, painful dwelling. Others have comparatively less effect but still painful enough to worry. In recent years, I avoided taking antibiotics largely, intensity of such swelling also decreased compared to 8yrs back. But issue persists whenever I take antibiotics. I am on a prescription at this moment for a stomach infection, using rifaximin occasionally, one tablet a day for a week or 10 days. \n\nBut this results in painful armpit swelling, pus. However, once pus drains, the wound heals pretty quick and feels like there was no problem until it strikes back again.\n\nI also had a minor incision and drainage done on neck regarding a lymph node. It was a one time thing and there's no problem with it since then. Tissue Biopsy report said no problem, as per the doc. I informed him about the Armpit problem too, he said it's common and probably nothing. He indicated that dirty blades used for shave could be a reason but I haven't put a blade in my armpit in last few years, always used a trimmer to avoid cuts.\n\nNeed some advice on what to do now and what the problem could be. I can post the neck's biopsy report if needed.

I immediately got a bad taste in my mouth after looking at the setup of NMM but didn't worry about that.  \n\n\nI checked Vortex one last time, before I started reinstalling EVERYTHING on NMM, and tried to download the mod that had the strangest error message.

This time, my computer asked me to search the Microsoft Store for an app to open the file. I've done multiple searches online and checked wikis, but haven't found a fix to this. I tried Google Chrome, because I was originally using Edge, but Google Chrome didn't even process the download. I dug into Vortex's settings and found that there was a button to fix the strange downloads. I pressed fix and the system told me it fixed Chrome.

{"id": "eh8n1v", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/eh8n1v/analysis_of_babylonia_effect_on_fanart_pixiv/", "title": "Analysis of Babylonia effect on Fanart (Pixiv)", "author": "Antiwhippy", "selftext": "So I've done my ranking of Babylonia clips for the 1st season (you can see it here https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/edp3tt/ranking_of_the_1st_season_babylonia_anime_clips/ ) but I thought another fun thing to look at would be how the anime might boost each character's popularity in fanart. \n\nSo to do this, I set the date range on Pixiv from 5th of October to the current date. I'm going to measure both the numbers and ratio, and ratio is more interesting because it's more indicative of the boost the anime gives. I'm just going to mix in all ages and R18 stuff. And where I can, I'll usually include Fate as a tag unless it seems to cut out an abnormal amount of fanart. It's not the best method, for example just searching for Merlin brings up quite a bit of 7 deadly sins stuff, but not to the point where it outweighs searching for #\u30de\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3 #fate. I'll list the variations each tags give, because for some the best tags are #name(fate). It's an imprecise thing really, tagging on pixiv. If there are better tags, please let me know and show the results too if you're able to.\n\nThe ratio will be displayed as (From babylonia start date):(All time)\n\nAlso keep in mind that this is for fun, it's not to say your favourite character is trash or whatever. Also keep in mind that Pixiv, while it's a big source for Japanese fanart, is not the only source, and quite a number of japanese artists posts heavily on twitter too, though most of them eventually posts it on pixiv too, but there are certainly a good number that doesn't.\n\nSo, for the fanarts ranking...\n\n1. Mash  \n#\u30de\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30ad\u30ea\u30a8\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8, 1791:23,446 (approx. 1:13)\nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nSo our resident eggplant is probably the easiest of the lot to search for because she's a unique character name and not a famous mythological entity which other media and anime has taken inspiration from, so I didn't feel the need to filter it out with Fate. As always, our Kouhai is super popular with the fanbase, but honestly though when it comes to ratio she's probably the worst performing, which just speaks to how popular she is beforehand. So it's not that the babylonia anime boosted her popularity really, it's just that her regular rate of fanart is still far more than the other characters.\n\n2. Ishtar  \n#\u30a4\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30eb, 1,623:5,112 (approx. 1:3.2)   \n#\u30a4\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30eb #Fate, 1,460:4,178 (approx. 1:2.9)   \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%20fate/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nNow Ishtar is another hard one to nail down because so many other media have used her name because she's one of the more well known sex pagan goddesses. Most of the fanart is still of FGO Ishtar, but you'll see some FEH, yugioh, danmachi, you get the point. Putting the fate tag seems to cut out some FGO Ishtar fanart but it's probably the more fair tag overall? My experience usually though is that if you want to find the most Ishtar fanart, leave the fate part out because it cuts out quite a few, and it's really just mostly fate ishtar ever since her introduction to the game.\n\nStill, either way, she's definitely the one to get the biggest boost both ratio-wise and numbers wise. She loses slightly to mash in numbers but blows her out of the water in ratio. It's kinda unfair though because space ishtar happened during this period, but in my experience it's still mostly earth ishtar.\n\n3. Enkidu  \n#\u30a8\u30eb\u30ad\u30c9\u30a5, 814:7117 (approx. 1:8.7)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%89%E3%82%A5/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30\n\nGilgamesh's perennial tag-a-long, while not a unique name, seems to not be used in any other media in a significant way and the tag is pretty much all Fate. Got a pretty decent boost, ratio-wise seems somewhat middling though.\n\nI don't know if it's worth doing a separate Kingu rating. Most of his stuff gets tagged alongside enkidu anyway.\n\n4. Gilgamesh or Gilgamesh(Caster)  \n#\u30ae\u30eb\u30ac\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 #fate, 802:17,896 (approx. 1:21)  \n#\u30ae\u30eb\u30ac\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5(\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc), 332:2440  (approx 1:7.3)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A1%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5(%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC)/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30\n\nFGO's resident pretty boi is honestly kinda hard to determine. The regular Gilgamesh tag and the Gilgamesh(caster) tags are fairly distinct, and while regular gilgmesh has more results, and regular gilgamesh tag would include gilgamesh(caster) most of the time anyway, but as you can see regular gilgamesh tag is more of a mashu situation when it comes to ratio, but gilgamesh(caster) tag got a pretty big boost ratio wise.\n\n4. Ereshkigal  \n#\u30a8\u30ec\u30b7\u30e5\u30ad\u30ac\u30eb #fate, 555:4,269 (approx. 1:8.3)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%82%AD%E3%82%AC%E3%83%AB/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30\n\nI tied Eresh with 4th because of the weirdness of the Gil tags, and this seems to be the best tag for her. Just like merlin just #\u30a8\u30ec\u30b7\u30e5\u30ad\u30ac\u30eb or #\u30a8\u30ec\u30b7\u30e5\u30ad\u30ac\u30eb(Fate) seems to produce less results.\n\nPretty decent boost and ratio considering that she isn't really in the anime yet. Expect more when she's properly revealed.\n\n5. Merlin  \n#\u30de\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3 #fate, 386:5,584 (approx  1:11.6)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%20fate/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nHonestly this is a weird one because for some reason adding the #fate tag seems to produce more results than just #\u30de\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3 or #\u30de\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3(Fate), which is usually not how it works?\n\nAnyway, didn't seem to get much of a boost, just seems like the regular rate either way. Still definitely one of the more popular characters.\n\n6. Ushiwakamaru  \n#\u725b\u82e5\u4e38(Fate), 318:1,567 (approx. 1:5)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E7%89%9B%E8%8B%A5%E4%B8%B8(Fate)/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nOne of the few ones where the #name(Fate) tag is the best tag for them. Definitely one of the winners when it comes to the ratio of fanart.\n\n7. Medusa(lancer)  \n#\u30e1\u30c9\u30a5\u30fc\u30b5(\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc), 288:739 (approx. 1:2.5)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%83%A1%E3%83%89%E3%82%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B5(%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC)/artworks\n\nHonestly a confusing one to search for. I thought Ana would be used more but it seems to be mostly Frozen fanart lmao. So I think this is probably the best tag for her. Biggest boost ratio wise, but yeah she didn't really have that much to begin with.\n\n8. Gorgon  \n#\u30b4\u30eb\u30b4\u30fc\u30f3, 86:460 (approx. 1:5.3)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nShe shares the tag with other non-fate related gorgon, but honestly putting the fate tag cuts out too much. Good boost, but definitely one of the smaller ones.\n\n9. Jaguarman  \n#\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 #fate, 63:242 (approx. 1:3.8)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%20fate/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nShares the same problem with quetz. #\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 #fate cuts out quite a bit, but #\u30b8\u30e3\u30ac\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 shares a lot with kemono friends and also just random furry art lol.\n\nPretty good boost overall from her fairly low count previously.\n\n10. Quetzcoatl\n#\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb #fate, 59:525 (approx 1:8.9)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%B1%E3%83%84%E3%82%A1%E3%83%AB%20fate/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nHonestly this is a super hard one to search for. Searching #\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb\u30fb\u30b3\u30a2\u30c8\u30eb instead of \u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb cuts out A LOT, but #\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb is shared quite a bit with miss kobayashi's dragon maid. #\u30b1\u30c4\u30a1\u30eb #fate seems to give the most fair result. \n\nNot too big of a boost honestly, especially considering she already had her highlight arc. But she also had the least time to have more fanart generated I guess?\n\n11. Siduri  \n#\u30b7\u30c9\u30a5\u30ea, 43:129 (approx. 1:3)  \nhttps://www.pixiv.net/en/tags/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%89%E3%82%A5%E3%83%AA/artworks?scd=2019-10-05&amp;ecd=2019-12-30&amp;s_mode=s_tag\n\nNothing else uses Siduri, so #\u30b7\u30c9\u30a5\u30ea is the best tag for her.\n\nPretty good boost, definitely the least popular numbers wise but one of the best ratio wise.\n\nWell, at the very least, I hope this post showed some people some good tags to search for on pixiv lol. Also I hope I didn't embarass myself mathematically.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:30:34+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:30:34+00:00", "subreddit": "grandorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_39d7x", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.grandorder", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 9, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/grandorder/comments/eh8n1v/analysis_of_babylonia_effect_on_fanart_pixiv/"}

Or am I better off on my own?", "author": "Throwawayquestions50", "selftext": "So I was kinda excited because this girl I was talking to really interested me. When I asked her to go out she agreed but I didn't get her number, when I asked for her number the following day she agreed but never showed to give it, so I just kept it moving. Now yesterday she was acting kinda funny and avoiding me.\n\nBefore I discuss this further I need to talk about my friend (or what I thought was a friend). I'm considered very, \"mature\" for my age despite the fact that I'm 20 and I look like I'm 12, so I always end up hanging out with people way older than me, or simply very strange people. Some of my older friends I haven't seen at all and one of my married friends got fired, so I've been kinda lonely at work again. There's this guy that's always talking about video games and shit so I figured we could be friends. Long story short, when he saw me talking to the girl he told me, \"she's out of your league\" and he was serious! He started talking about how I couldn't get her. \n\nGetting back to the girl, I had another guy I also considered a friend come up to talk to me. I didn't have anyone to share how I was feeling with, so I told him about the situation. He told me he overheard her talking about her boyfriend, so to me I was just annoyed and confused. Why would she accept a date knowing she had a damn boyfriend? Why didn't she just say she wasn't interested rather than going out of her way for my attention?\n\nOnce I calmed down later I started thinking and tbh I started losing confidence in people I thought I could trust. How do I know my second friend didn't just want her for himself and try to talk me out of pursuing her. And what friend would belittle someone they care about? Every time a guy has come to me to say who he likes, I would try to give him confidence and tell him to go talk to her, not tell him he's, \"too nice\" for her and that he doesn't have a chance.\n\nIn seduction does a man have friends?

The website and many residents claim that there are 18 floors in the building. Recently, a rumor started going around claiming that there are actually on 17 floors in The Rise, and that the 18th floor was a hoax. Residents claimed not only had they never seen the 18th floor, but they didn't even know anyone that lived on the supposed top floor. At first, people who didn't live in The Rise thought the theory didn't hold any water. They laughed at it even. They though it was sort of like the \"North Dakota\" conspiracy, where no one knew anyone from North Dakota and no one had been to North Dakota so they believed North Dakota didn't exist. Plus, you can clearly see the 18th floor from outside the building.\n\n However, when one steps on the elevator in The Rise, there are only 17 buttons. If there are 18th floors as the website and officials say, why isn't there an 18th button? It's an apartment complex, and the elevator is one of the main ways to get from floor to floor. There's no real way to get to the 18th floor. But like I said, it definitely exists because you can clearly see it outside. So the idea the floor doesn't exist is dumb, but there is something strange going on. It's more of a local thing so I'm not sure this subreddit approves of that or not, but I think it's worth discussing. The only video I can find more about it on is linked below.\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfkRZbdM3eY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfkRZbdM3eY)", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:30:07+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:30:08+00:00", "subreddit": "UnresolvedMysteries", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wvvc", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.UnresolvedMysteries", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/eh8muu/the_18th_floor_of_the_rise_in_college_station/"}

In some ways it is a supernatural horror like that of an old ghost story, but as the plot develops, the threat(s) begins to take a more existential and cosmic tone. \n\nI have learned a few things about how to make your threats actually scary from other writers, including some of Stephen King\u2019s discussions, but think I\u2019d gain more about hearing what scares my fellow redditors. The difficult thing about writing horror is that there can be no shortcuts, and you can\u2019t scare the same people with the same things. Whatever it is you scare people with, it must echo something primal in yourself and others.\n\nWhat are your experiences with proper literature  horror? Was it easy or hard to write? And why?

I have read that it is recommended to quarantine them for the first two weeks that you bring them home. Does that mean to quarantine them just from other ferrets or other animals as well? I don\u2019t plan on them interacting with my dogs until they decompress but I didn\u2019t know if there is a risk of \u201ccontaminating\u201d parts of my home where my dogs go? So does that mean keeping them confined to playing in one room and not allowing them to run around my living room/any other areas in my house for two weeks?\n\n2. Do you find there is a difference in personalities based on gender? For example, some dog breeds the males tend to be goofier/more lovey and females more serious/independent. \n\n3. I have read that ferrets are very intelligent and can actual learn tricks/shape behaviors, what do you guys recommend for a light/healthy training treat? I have seen bags of treats in the store for them but they seem to be more like a \u201cdessert\u201d and not something I would want to give multiples of for training purposes. \n\n4. I have not made a decision on whether I\u2019ll be adopting, purchasing, or finding a rehome situation. There is a locally owned pet store near me that supposedly gets their ferrets from a private breeder and not Marshalls. What kind of questions should I ask the pet store to determine if they are a reputable breeder or not? No matter where I purchase one from, what kind of vetting records should I be looking for? Up to date rabies and CDV? \n\n\nThank you!!", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:54+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:55+00:00", "subreddit": "ferrets", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn1", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.ferrets", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ferrets/comments/eh8mr2/first_time_ferret_owner/"}

If you like any of these prompts or have your own send me a PM and we can discuss more details. \n\nInterracial: We can discuss further but I've always wanted to do something like this. \n\nThe girl no one wants: For this idea you'd be playing a woman a typical person wouldn't find sexy. Rather it be someone on the heavier side, a goth/emo girl, a music festival girl, anything. We can discuss further in PMs\n\nThe help: I'm apart of a very wealthy family and therefore we have many people working for us. You'll play the part of the workers rather that be the maid, the chef, a tennis instructor, my mom's masseuse. It'll follow my way of seducing whoever i want.\n\nFree use: This has many different ways it can go. Let's create one together. \n\nLibrarian: Don't have an idea but open to brainstorming one.\n\nBabysitter: I'm a 23 year old single dad and one of the cities most prominent bachelors. I've got a great job and i nice apartment downtown. One night when i get home from a business party i see the babysitter with a welcome home surprise. \n\nPokemon: I'd love for someone to play a not normal trainer role. Maybe a nurse joy or officer Jenny. Or perhaps a canon character like misty, may, dawn, or cynthia. If you want to play an OC I'm sure we can figure out a scene together. \n\nNun: this one i don't have a prompt for so we can come up with one together. \n\nIncest: This is one of my favorites and I'd love for you to play either aunt/mom/grandma. I have a few scenes but would love to hear yours. \n\nCamgirl: I've been one of you're biggest supporters since you started. I'm a top patreon supporter. I always buy custom videos and I'm constantly buying stuff off you're wishlist. One day you message me privately saying you need a new roommate and ask if i can move in.\n\nPornstar: You're a well known pornstar and as part of a contest the winner gets to stay a weekend with you in a nice house in Malibu. \n\nCelebrity: You're a famous celebrity and one summer after college i come spend time with my girlfriend and thats when i see her mom is a celebrity. (We can discuss celebs) \n\nSugar momma: Your a rich business women and that has cost you many relationships including your sons father. He left because you were to focused on work. You don't have time for a relationship but you still have needs. Thats when you decide you'll spoil your son rotten if he satisfies you. \n\nThese are just a few of my ideas. If you like any of them or want to discuss potential prompts PM me.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:53+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:54+00:00", "subreddit": "DirtyKIKRoleplay", "subreddit_id": "t5_3kem5", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.DirtyKIKRoleplay", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/DirtyKIKRoleplay/comments/eh8mqv/m4f_early_morning_smutty_rp_free_all_day/"}

There's no difference in battery life between 1080P and 1440P: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPpM9tesPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncPpM9tesPc) \n2. So should you just set it at 1440P then? Sure, however setting it at 1440P will strain the GPU a bit more so you may notice more stutters when using the phone, mainly when gaming.\n3. Why does Samsung set their phones at 1080P, then? My guess is due to how the phone treats 1080P and 1440P. Basically in order to make the phone 1440P it makes the green pixels brighter, so if you want less potential for burn-in set it at 1080P. Here's a more in depth post if you're interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/695l1g/basics\\_on\\_pentile\\_amoled\\_displays\\_the\\_real\\_reason/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/695l1g/basics_on_pentile_amoled_displays_the_real_reason/)  \n\nTo wrap up, just leave the phone at 1440P, there's no loss in battery life or performance. And if you really care about gaming just set it to 1080P via Game Launcher. Burn-in won't be an issue as long as if you don't leave your phone at max brightness on a static screen for hours, and in normal usage it would take years for burn-in to happen naturally. Oh and don't use 720P, not unless you like to pretend that your phone is from 2012 or something.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:36+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:37+00:00", "subreddit": "galaxys10", "subreddit_id": "t5_2x95j", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.galaxys10", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 15, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/galaxys10/comments/eh8mm0/which_screen_resolution_should_i_use_and_why/"}

The general consensus was... probs not. He is played by a different actor that is a different ethnicity and body size as homelander, so it probably just isn't in the cards to make that plot twist again.... also it keeps the comic readers guessing... would be a shame if everyone who read the comics knew how the show was going to end.\n\nMy newest theory though is Homelander's son is probably going to be the one to kill him. He shares the same DNA as homelander. Looks like the same super powers. The only difference is he was raised in a real home and has probably worked with Voggelbaum and Vought im guessing. Probably as a secret plan B.

But as we\u2019ve had little alone time since the holidays have begun, when my BIL\u2019s family were invited round for their own family celebrations (exchange of gifts since they were apart over Christmas), we decided to excuse ourselves, thinking they would prefer to be amongst close family and we could do with a break. We stayed in our bedroom yesterday to have a nap and today went out to the movies.

I use BTC for international money transfer and for a typical 500cad transfer to Europe, my loss comes down to about 17cad after the round trip.\n\nSo I wanted to see if Binance has better options. After the KYC, I got to the page for buying with fiat, and right away I noticed that though the price of 1 BTC to USD on Google was $7,392 simplex were offering $7,658 (-3.6%) while Koinal was offering $7,719 (-4.4%) and this is in addition to the 2.5% fee they are listing. \nFor small values, Koinal is better as the percentages are uniform, (100usd worth translates to 95.89usd on Koinal but 89.65usd worth of BTC from simplex because simplex charges a flat 10usd for smaller amounts.\nHowever for 1000usd you'll get a better deal from Simplex (about - 3.2% loss as against 4.1% for Koinal).\n\nWhile these fees are not as bad as some BTC ATM or localcoin, it doesn't work well for fiat tob crypto to fiat conversion. \n\nI'll stick with Kraken for now.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:25+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:26+00:00", "subreddit": "BitcoinCA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wqe8", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.BitcoinCA", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 15, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BitcoinCA/comments/eh8mj4/buying_btc_on_binance_with_card/"}

Its now gradually spread to everything else, kissing, hugging, holding hands...everything. I loved getting my head scratched...and when I ask she just sighs or rolls her eyes and then either gives it a half hearted go or says no.\n\n\nI've tried speaking to her and initially she said it was just self confidence issues and her disliking her appearance (she put on a tiny bit of weight when she had the baby), but recently shes said that we've grown apart and that we need to 'fix us' before we can get back to where we were. \n\nUnfortunately, she hasn't given me an indication of how, even when asked. she doesnt appear to be making any effort to change things from her side, but has said she's trying to get out of her funk. Shes been doing that by with spending more time with friends, getting back into football and doing more things for her...but if anything I'm seeing even less of her.\n\nI dont know what to do, I feel like it would be so easy to do the wrong thing and push our relationship over the edge and I just want to to find a way to move forward and repair our relationship.\n\nWhat should I do?

Might be on the wrong subreddit but some advice would be highly appreciated too. TDLR at the bottom.\n\nI\u2019m 18 and i have many close friends, close meaning we share a deep connection and we trust each other with our problems and feelings. However, in the recent 2 years, i haven\u2019t been too attentive on them. They\u2019ve been by my side, offering advice whenever i needed them and vice versa, but i havent spent time hanging out with them in person. I\u2019ve been busy with school and exams and i\u2019ve been lazy to go out as well. Also, i have a boyfriend whom i\u2019m frankly speaking very into. I invest a lot of my time into my relationship with him because i often feel that we lack the time to spend together as he has strict parents. As a result, all my free time is put into my relationship, therefore neglecting my other friends.\n\nI know the solution is simple, talk to my friends more and give them more time and go out with them more, but i still feel helpless. After so long, i finally feel the gap between my friends and I. I think they\u2019ve started to lose trust in me and they\u2019ve given up inviting me to hang out. It\u2019s nothing personal when i\u2019m unable to hang out with them because my parents expect me to spend a lot of time with my family as well. So most of my time has been put into family, studies and my boyfriend. I love my boyfriend a lot and i don\u2019t want to risk losing him. He\u2019s fine with me spending time with my friends but i still choose to give most of my time to him. I do feel ashamed now and i don\u2019t know how to make it up to my friends. And reiterating my point, my family wants me to put them first, so i do have to reject outings with friends too. I really feel on the verge of losing everybody and i can\u2019t think straight now. I do love my friends as well, and i do not choose not to hang out with them because i hate them. Sometimes i genuinely am lazy to go out and i don\u2019t have cash to go out and spend. \n\nI think they think i give too much of my time to my boyfriend and i can\u2019t deny that either. I truly believe that i can marry this guy in future, thus i put in so much effort into it. But in the process, i seem to have forgotten about my friends. I do hit them up from time to time, but maybe that isn\u2019t enough for them. Maybe i am not putting enough effort into my friendships. Please help me out here, because i truly believe that it\u2019s nothing personal, i just choose to spend more time with my family and my boyfriend and when i feel like it, i\u2019ll hit my friends up. I feel like a major asshole and i do want to make it up to them, but it wouldn\u2019t change the fact that i don\u2019t really want to go out. Even if i spend time with my boyfriend, it\u2019s usually going over to his place or him coming over. \n\nTLDR; i think i haven\u2019t been putting effort into my friendships and my friends are starting to drfit from me. i place too much of my attention on my family and my boyfriend, but it\u2019s nothing personal to my friends and i don\u2019t hate them. i guess i just focus more on my relationship and family, but i think i\u2019m hurting my friends. what should i do?", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:16+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:17+00:00", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/eh8mg9/i_f18_think_im_losing_all_my_friends_and_i_dont/"}

I also didn't feel that the club was happy. I felt I never fit in there from the very beginning.\" [Quotes from documentary]", "author": "kazcmot", "selftext": "**\"I know many will think I'm crazy, but it's important to me that when I look down, I see white shoes. I don't know if it's a psychological problem, but I need white shoes to play. I don't feel good without them\u201d** says Toni Kroos at the start of the documentary about myself. The German cleans his shoes in Valdebebas in the team's staff room. The stage seems quite strange for a player of Real Madrid and even prepared for a movie about his life, but Bale in a moment confirms that Kroos is the only player who cleans his shoes himself. **\"He always has the same 2-3 pairs of white adidas 11pro and we think he doesn't trust anyone about them, so he always cleans them himself to perfection.\"**\n\nThe documentary about Kroos reveals a slightly more brilliant player and a peculiar man who is unknown to the wider public besides what he does on the pitch. **\"He is a great person. He may seem antipatic, but he does his best. His calmness and confidence are amazing. This is the key, \"** says his mother.\n\n**Jessy's wife is one of the pillars of his life**\n\n&gt;\"Toni is an emotional man. Sometimes, he just puts a wall around him so that he does not immediately reveal himself to someone unknown to him. When I present him to my friends, please make him kind, because sometimes his behavior may seem a bit strange. He  dooesn't seems interested in anything or dislikes talking like others, but the reality is that he needs more time to open up, \"says his wife, who also reveals their secrets to living in Madrid.\n\n&gt;\"We live in Madrid for 5 years and we never went to the city. We are not too urban. We prefer to sit at home like some grandparents. At the beginning, leaving Toni was still possible, but it seems impossible to me since 2014, \"says Jessica. \"I like sitting at home,\" adds Kroos. \"After team matches I always hurry to spend the night at home. It gives me strength. When I get home, I forget about the result, about victory or failure. At home I am husband and father. It makes me able to function. \"\n\n**Interestingly, the couple met in Spain. However, not in Mayorca, where they have a house, but in the Canary Islands. Specifically in Fuerteventura.**\n\n&gt;\"Toni was 18, I was 20. I wouldn't say it was love at first sight, but he is a wonderful man. Shortly afterwards, we met in Germany and began to be together. \"\n\n&gt;\"When Jessy entered my life, everything made more sense because I had something more important than football,\" concludes the midfielder. \"I would lie if I said we never argued, but I never slept on the couch. We reconcile quickly. \"\n\n**Advice from grandparents, his big fans**\n\nToni Kroos also discovers one of the biggest tips from his grandfather who doesn't miss any Real Madrid match. \n\n&gt;\"Don't run too much in the first half, save energy for the second. I usually listen to him, \"says the madridist. What else does grandfather advise? \"I often see the goalkeeper lying down and the players are not shooting up. I tell him to lift the ball, but he doesn't always listen to me. \"\n\nGrandfather distinguishes him in peace. \n\n&gt;\"He took it all from his father, not me. He knows what he is capable of. Also: how should he get angry with such a technique? \" Grandmother is more critical: \"I don't like these paintings on his shoulders. And he knows it well. \"\n\n**Capable of reading Whatsapp ... during the match break**\n\n&gt;Jaime Benito, his private physiotherapist and for many years an employee on the first team of Real Madrid, tells what Kroos is during the break and after the matches. In the document, he talks to the German and tells him: \"You never get nervous. I saw you talking on the phone with Jessy just before going out on the pitch. You put the phone in your bag and left the locker room. During the break, you took a phone call, replied to a message like \"I will buy tomatoes when I come back\" and you have returned to the pitch. Not everyone can keep such a cool head. \"\n\n&gt;\"But that's probably good, isn't it?\" Replies Kroos. \"It's not that football doesn't matter to me, but I just know what to do and trust in what I do. It is just that simple. Football is not something that irritates me. \"\n\n**Without \"feeling\" with Bayern, in love with Real**\n\n&gt;The film makes it clear that Kroos's relationship with Bayern has never been good. At least, they were not what they are in Real Madrid, where the player is completely happy. His agent adds: \"When Toni played in Leverkusen, he didn't want to go back to Munich. He was happy there and did not want to go back, but he had to do it by contract because his loan was ending. \"\n\n&gt;\"In the end, I chose the hardest path and came back to fight for a place in Bayern,\" says Kroos. \"I came back and signed a new contract. I signed it in Rummenigge's office and regretted it after 10 minutes. I also didn't feel that the club was happy. I think I never fit in there from the very beginning, \" In 2014, he broke the contract and was bought by Real.\n\n&gt;\"We offered him our top and we said: take it or leave,\" says Uli Hoene\u00df, who was surprised by the player's reply. \"After a second, he answered: I'm leaving. He surprised me, but I like such people with principles. \" His agent sums up: \"We could not accept that he would not be among the highest paid in the team.\"\n\n**Key wife in renewing the contract with Real**\n\n&gt;At the beginning of June Kroos extended his contract with Real Madrid and exuded his and family's happiness before the CEO Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez. \"My wife is happy, it's a good signal for the club, right?\" Sanchez has no doubt: \"Something great. If the family is not satisfied, you are not doing well. We are also happy with this contract. Our German players have always been excellent, but the most important is you, Toni. \"\n\n**Mother's tears when he left home**\n\n&gt;For a long time, his father Roland coached him in Hans Rostock, which, according to Kroos, affected his relationship with his father. \"Dad was 50% father and 50% coach. Of course, then you lose something. If you train with your father, he should treat you like the rest. Or maybe even harder. I didn't protest because I thought it was a good thing, but if I think about it now, I exaggerated a little. I think it has affected our father-son relationship a little. \"\n\n&gt;His father also looks at things differently over time. \"After the matches, we analyzed them together. I think I wouldn't do that now. I would leave the kids alone. \"\n\n&gt;In turn, my mother tells how she suffered when Toni left home at the age of 16. \"For me it was very difficult. I cried many times and at the beginning I also set the table for him, although he was gone. At the age of 16 he went to play soccer in Bayern, and I felt that my son would never go home again. It was so ... \".\n\n**His friend Robbie Williams wants him at United**\n\n&gt;The documentary also reveals the friendship that connects Kroos with Robbie Williams. The singer defines himself as a football lover and an absolute fan of Toni, whom he asks to move to Manchester United. \"He won everything in Real, so please: go to United! We have the best league in the world, Premier League. That's why this one thing hurts me so much. Real Madrid made me feel tiny, like he had a little bird. Football is my religion and I don't like it when there are other gods bigger than mine, \u201dadmits the artist.\n\n**\"Staged\" Merkel after winning the World Cup**\n\n&gt;Perhaps Real Madrid's personality is best described by one scene. Germany became world champions after defeating Argentina on Maracan. The celebration began all over on the pitch and moved to the cloakroom. Chancellor Angela Merkel descends there to take a picture of herself with each and to congratulate herself. However, Kroos is not on the official photo sent to the media by the federation. Where was the madridist then?\n\n&gt;He is not in the picture, because then he took off and took care of his shoes, remaining on the side of all euphoria. \"I was as happy as anyone inside, but I'm not the type of person who shows it outside. I don't regret not having this picture. I don't need to be at the center of these celebrations. \"\n\n[Source](https://www.realmadryt.pl/news/93224-sekrety-toniego-kroosa)", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:29:15+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:29:16+00:00", "subreddit": "soccer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.soccer", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 191, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/soccer/comments/eh8mfx/kroos_i_chose_the_hardest_path_in_2010_and_came/"}

No minimums required. \n- Top players always keep donations filled. No minimums required. If you do donate, only give what's requested. \n- TH12s are highly active and frequently donate any type of max sieges for non-war attacks. Makes it easier for farming and trophy pushing. \n- We war nonstop. Basic rules apply: use both attacks, and targets should make sense with real war strats (i.e. no looting).\n- We go for 3 stars every time, unless situation dictates otherwise.\n- We run 30v30 in CWL to maximize medal earning potential for everyone.\n- We have developed a culture of dependability. Everyone uses all war attacks, and there are consequences for those who don't. We achieved this by reinforcing expectations and weeding out slackers.\n- Elder is awarded to consistent contributors to wars and CWL (but mostly CWL).\n- Chat is active. Just about all players log in every day and will respond to chat when it's there, especially on war days. Chat is courteous, constructive, and informative.\n- Players from all over the world are invited, but the clan is English-speaking and primarily from the U.S.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/fWsfUDm", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:58+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:59+00:00", "subreddit": "ClashOfClansRecruit", "subreddit_id": "t5_30jzq", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.ClashOfClansRecruit", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ClashOfClansRecruit/comments/eh8mb6/recruiting_cloners_th9_clan_level_8_clan_warscwl/"}

I am a wage slave at Caffe Nero in one of London's busiest stations (takeaway only), and I have been feeling a degree of disgust and guilt when I see the prices for our drinks going up and up and up. So I decided to pop on here and offer people some advice for how not to get ripped off by my employer. \n\n1) At my store, we charge \u00a32.80 for a regular latte and \u00a33.05 for a large. People often say that they want a large because they 'need to stay awake' etc, but in reality they are getting no more coffee than if they were to get a regular. Exactly the same amount of coffee goes in each. Also, the large cup is slightly narrower than the regular. If you fill a regular cup up with water and then pour it into a large, it comes up to maybe 1cm max from the rim. You are paying 25 pence extra for less than a mouthful of milk. \n\n2) If you order a double espresso, you will pay \u00a32.25. If you buy two single espressos (same amount of coffee, same amount of cardboard in one double/2 single cups), you pay \u00a33.80. You are getting the same thing. I would recommend asking for a double espresso, and then asking if you can take two single cups. Split them between the two cups. 2 single espressos, \u00a31.55 saved. If you are feeling cheeky and you have a good server, ask for a double espresso split between two single cups. Some of us would oblige (in fact some of us just. charge a \u00a32.25 for 2 singles anyway, but you didn't hear anything from me), but others will take issue with it. \n\n3) As above, but with cortados and flat whites. A flat white is a cortado x 2 in a double cup, more or less, or a cortado is half a flat white in a single cup. 1 flat white is \u00a32.85, two cortados, \u00a35.00.\n\nAlso, it costs \u00a32.15 for a teabag and a cup of hot water. This is absurd. Tea is a human right.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:57+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:57+00:00", "subreddit": "CasualUK", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2jr", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.CasualUK", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 569, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/CasualUK/comments/eh8mav/some_advice_from_a_caffe_nero_employee/"}

At the time of this even taking place I was working at a shitty Chinese/Hispanic buffet.\n\nCustomers would always feel the need to make inappropriate comments, stare at me the entire time they were there, or sometimes I would even be grabbed or touched by the customers since the target demographic for this place was old guys who aren\u2019t all there mentally. It wasn\u2019t a huge problem though because my manager had a gun on him at all times and wouldn\u2019t let people stay if they did anything creepy. Sometimes I would be threatened by guys saying they\u2019d wait out in the parking lot for me when we close and my manager or my boyfriend would walk me to my car when I got off. \n\nOne day a man came in saying that there was a phone right outside in our parking lot. This man hadn\u2019t been in previously which I would have known because I was a hostess and I sat everyone in the restaurant down myself, I thought it was odd that someone who wasn\u2019t at our restaurant was saying there was a phone in our parking lot, but I assumed they maybe were in one of the stores next door, so i didn\u2019t mind going out to get it.\n\nThis man points to the back of the parking lot and says it\u2019s back there, which struck me as even more strange because there were multiple stores right next to that side of the parking lot. I continue walking to where he said it was when this man gets in his truck and waits back where he said the phone was. I remembered my glasses were hanging on my shirt so I put them on to see where the phone was and it was a crushed Mountain Dew can In the middle of the road.\n\nSince it was getting dark around that time, I decided to just turn around and go back inside. The man followed me in his truck to the front of the restaurant and asked if I was having trouble finding it. I told him that it was a crushed soda can. He then insisted that there was a phone out there and asked if he could drive me to where it was. I told him I had to get back to work and went back inside and he yelled after me but drove off once I was inside. \n\nI was really spooked by this so I had to have my boyfriend come down to my work to walk me out to my car and the same truck was off in the back of the parking lot and there were two people I\u2019ve never seen before parked next to my car. I don\u2019t know if I just misinterpreted the situation or if I almost got trafficked that day, but to the guy who tried getting me to go to the back of the parking lot alone with you, let\u2019s not meet again.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:55+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:56+00:00", "subreddit": "cjades_scarystories", "subreddit_id": "t5_117emx", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.cjades_scarystories", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/cjades_scarystories/comments/eh8mak/to_the_man_who_tried_to_traffick_me_at_work_lets/"}

He was the sweetest guy ever and made me feel so good about myself I stopped going to the gym everyday cause he said I didn\u2019t need to. I still look the same but now he\u2019s way different.\n\nWhen he started college everything changed. He has been making remarks like if I dont do something for him sexually he\u2019ll have one of the girls at his dorm do it for him. We haven\u2019t been on a date in a year but he has a female best friend that he has also had a sexual relationship with he seems to look highly of. He bought her a really expensive trip somewhere for her birthday and for Christmas I didn\u2019t get anything. Birthday is coming and he\u2019s made it clear I\u2019m not getting anything for that.\n\nHe kicks me out of his dorm whenever I bother him. The most notable being at 1am when I wouldn\u2019t do a sexual favor for him while I was trying to sleep for work. The result of this time was me breaking up with him and he sent me a picture of a really cut arm saying it was my fault. Of course we got back together. \n\nRecently he\u2019s even gone as far as sexting other girls and going to his ex\u2019s house alone. He has been making comments of how fat and unattractive I am cause I have a small butt and I should wear makeup even though I\u2019m actually pretty slim and am told by others I\u2019m pretty. He even said that his dad and his dads friends expect him to go to college and have as much sex as possible. He mentioned that cheating isn\u2019t cheating if he used a condom.\n\nI however had to block every guy I knew. I can\u2019t drink like he does so I\u2019m not allowed to go out. He doesn\u2019t want me making friends, and I have to sit and listen to him hoot about all the other girls he could have and spoil while I pay for my own coffee at Starbucks.\n\nHe says I\u2019m just jealous and even if I left him no one else would want me. I don\u2019t know what to do. I love who he was before but since he has started school he makes me feel so bad I hate myself for crying all the time. It doesn\u2019t make it any better that he\u2019s white and into black girls and me being black his family talks bad about me and encourages him to date his black ex. They didn\u2019t even give me a chance.\n\nWhat should I do? Be honest. I have been called jealous so much I need an unbiased opinion.", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:44+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:45+00:00", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.relationship_advice", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 11, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/eh8m7g/should_i_22f_leave_him_18m/"}

Estes assuntos mais sens\u00edveis parecem ser sempre tratados como um n\u00e3o assunto por parte da Media. As not\u00edcias a que fa\u00e7o refer\u00eancia s\u00e3o dos meses de Maio e Junho deste ano .*\n\nUm dos objectivos deste projecto consiste em que qualquer pessoa dentro do espa\u00e7o da CPLP (composto por Portugal, Brasil, Angola, Mo\u00e7ambique, Cabo Verde, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, Guin\u00e9-Bissau, Guin\u00e9-Equatorial e Timor-Leste) se possa movimentar dentro da comunidade sem qualquer tipo de controlo fronteiri\u00e7o.

[link](https://observador.pt/2019/06/11/portugal-e-cabo-verde-unidos-pela-livre-circulacao-esperam-boas-noticias-na-cplp/)\n\nE segundo o primeiro ministro\n\n&gt;\"Foi um dos erros grandes que se cometeu quando nos anos 90 foi negociado o Acordo de Schengen n\u00e3o se ter ressalvado, como alguns pa\u00edses fizeram, as suas rela\u00e7\u00f5es privilegiadas \" [link](https://observador.pt/2019/06/11/portugal-e-cabo-verde-unidos-pela-livre-circulacao-esperam-boas-noticias-na-cplp/)\n\nS\u00f3 para indicar que na cita\u00e7\u00e3o em cima, o coment\u00e1rio do primeiro ministro n\u00e3o tem qualquer nexo.

I'm currently in high school (11th grade) and I've been planning to tell my mom and sister to support me with my future plans. They are already paying for my studies and giving me allowance as I study right now, I just need their blessing to do that but in overseas which of course is gonna be a more burden but I want to discuss the later benefits for myself and my family so I could get the sweet, sweet, yes, son, get on the plane.\n\nBefore, I thought of finishing my college here in the Philippines (gonna take Software Engineering/Computer Science btw), get some 2-3 years work experience then fly away to another country and hope that an employer will accept me or I'll end up as a bachelor of Tim Horton's s or study again because your local credentials kinda goes back to zero since their standard is a whole lot different which is gonna add a lot more years before I can have a comfortable work and life.\n\nBut the catch is that if I study and earn my bachelor degree in the US or Canada then I will get a higher and better chances of getting accepted to a good-paying job here, then possibly apply for citizenship later on.\n\nAs my family said, studying isn't for them, it's for me, I just wanna give myself the best path I could think of to secure a good future. I've been always aiming to become a software engineer or a game developer in tech companies. \n\nEnough of the plans though, right now I can say that I'm an above-average student, my overall average is B+, I get grades high as A- and lowest at B-. I'm not the smartest or rustiest kid in class but I believe I have some potentials to prove myself that I deserve to study abroad. My family isn't rich, we aren't poor either. We are somewhere between average and above-average, my sister is working, my mother is working but my dad is gonna retire soon.\n\nI hope I can convince them but how am gonna do it? I heard some people do silly powerpoint presentations, maybe a lengthy awkward talk, or a straight-forward \"Mom, study abroad, please\". I don't wanna be seen like I know everything and that I'm thinking too much of an adult that I'm taking too many risk, like a really big risk and I'm too sure, I want them to see my dedication and passion for this but I don't know how to start and say it. \n\nAdvance thanks for any good advices that will be sent.

Raid: Shadow Legends is a mobile-fantasy RPG game for mobile and PC developed by Plarium Games. The game takes place in Teleria, which has been subjugated by the Dark Lord Siroth. The player goes through twelve levels in single player mode, with a multiplayer PVP mode deciding player rankings. While it is a popular app, the game has gained notoriety online because it is heavily advertised in YouTube videos.\n\nWhat is Raid Shadow Legends?\n\nRAID: Shadow Legends is a fantasy-themed, turn based role-playing gacha-game. The game's story takes place in the fictional realm of Teleria, which has been subjugated by the Dark Lord Siroth. Players take the role of an ancient Telerian warrior resurrected to defeat the Dark Lord and restore peace and harmony to the territory. Players must assemble an army for battles in settings such as castles, dungeons, deserts and temples defended by enemies and possible allies and throughout the game, players accumulate Shards, vessels containing the souls of past warriors. Shards come in four types with different properties.\n\nThe game consists primarily of a 12-level story-driven single-player (PvE) campaign, each level made up of seven stages with three levels of difficulty. The PvE campaign is interconnected with a multiplayer (PvP) component to decide player rankings.\n\nThe game's narrative was written by Paul C.R. Monk, and the game adopts a Western art style, with realistic characters, and settings inspired by dark fantasy.\n\nThanks again to Raid: Shadow Legends for sponsoring this video", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:30+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:31+00:00", "subreddit": "copypasta", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r6z7", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.copypasta", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/copypasta/comments/eh8m3m/raid_shadow_legends/"}

I have been roleplaying for a couple of years now, i'm a twenty years old male from Europe. I'm not a native English speaker so sometimes i make some mistakes, i'm trying to keep them at the minium. I'm looking for a partner in crime to create a romantic story, i don't mind males, females or anything in between.\n\nMy writing style: I usually use the third person and past tense, my replies are usually 100-300 words but they can be longer. I always try to keep my writing as detailed as possible.\n\nAbout the roleplay: It can be medieval, steampunk, modern, historical, futuristic. I won't play fandoms, i'm not a huge fan of them. I prefer to create with my partner our world and characters. It can contain NSFW elements if my partner is fine with them.\n\n---\n\nThese are a couple of my ideas with an introduction. \n\n**[Medieval] Stolen heart**\n\nThis scenario is about a thief and a princess, they meet in her chamber when he was trying to stole her jewelry. This story could be everywhere, it is up to us. We can even make the princess a prince and the thief a woman.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe cold wind of winter was blowing inside one of the castle's chamber pushing some papers on the floor, the sound of someone walking on the marble floor was slightly audible. The thief was searching in every drawer, the bag was full of jewels but he wanted more, he wanted to stole everything he could. The dinner usually lasted for one entire hours so he had time... at least it was what he thought. The ebony door suddenly was opened, his emerald eyes searched for a way out but he was too far away from the window. He had to quickly make a decision. When the door was closed he rushed towards the person who just entered in the room and he pinned their body on the wall, his hand was over their mouth. His eyes widened, she was the princess/prince.\n\n**[Modern] The newcomer**\n\nThis scenario is set in a highschool or college, the story begin in the second semester when my character goes for the first time in his new school. Your character could be a student or a teacher or whatever you want. \n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe sun was melting the snow on the roofs of the building in front of the school, the smoke which was coming from his cigarette was slowly making its way towards the sky. Alexander's back was leaned against the brick wall, it was cold so he was wearing a black coat and under it a white shirt. Blue jeans were trying to protect from the cold his longs legs which with the help of the chest were making his height of 6 feet. His sapphire eyes moved towards the arms of the huge clock inside of the school, he was late for his first lesson in the new school. He threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on it, he began to walk towards the classroom number B-22.\n\nAlex felt the gaze of everyone on him, it was the second semester and he was the newcomer so he was already expecting it. His long blonde and curly hair moved like waves every step he made, the map on his hand was indicating the path he had to take to get in the classroom. After a couple of minutes of walking the writing B-22 was on the door in front of him, he took a huge breath and opened the door.\n\n**[Anything] Bring your own idea!**\n\n---\n\nPlease send me a PM if you are interested in roleplaying with me. Send me a little description of you and in what types of scenarios are you interested.

I have a bad habit of not asking people seriously to do things until I\u2019m already pissed off. I have mentioned cleaning the floors more often in passing pretty much every time I do it (usually once a week). I have a few times directly asked my roommates to do it when they have the day off work and they only do it about half the time. \n\nMy roommate has a dog with long hair that collects into hair balls in the hall and covers the rug after about half a week. Today I asked my roommates if they could keep up with cleaning these things better and my one roommate (honestly, I don\u2019t like her) said that she cleans \u201call the time.\u201d Bullshit. Also if she\u2019d just brush her dog more than once every two months this wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue. \n\nI was out of town last week Monday-Saturday and in that time the rug was not vacuumed at all, and hadn\u2019t been vacuumed recently enough before I left. My roommates were only gone Christmas Day. The roommate that claims she cleans all the time spends her days off work sitting in bed watching tv and smoking weed, she\u2019s done this the last two days while I\u2019ve been cleaning. I usually spend my days off cleaning the floors, toilets, etc. I know it\u2019s my choice to do this but if it was maintained I wouldn\u2019t have to clean so deeply every time I\u2019m off work.\n\nSo, is it my fault I can\u2019t relax because I\u2019m too uptight about how clean things should be? Which is really not clean at all, I just don\u2019t want piles of dirt and hair on the floor, and I want space in the sink to wash my dishes. Is it unfair to expect other people to maintain your level of cleanliness when they clearly don\u2019t care about living in filth? Is it worth continuing to confront my roommates about or should I just clean things up and let it go? I have already ordered a chore chart so we can keep better track of when things are being cleaned... I just want to relax. I wish I could have no roommates but I can\u2019t afford my mortgage without them. Are there actually people out there who keep things clean like I do??? This has been an issue with almost every roommate I\u2019ve had.\n\nTl;dr I don\u2019t think my roommates are helping clean, but they say they are, I have not seen them clean and things were left uncleaned when I went out of town, what can I do?", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:22+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:24+00:00", "subreddit": "relationships", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.relationships", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/eh8m1f/i_25m_dont_know_how_to_talk_to_my_roommates_25m/"}

By the time the news reached Bruce the war had already started.\n\nWar is a concept familiar with Bruce. He served in the Olathian War. He was only 16 when he got drafted, but Bruce remembers very little of the war, as he pushed the memories of shellshock and bombings to the deep depth of his mind... But the effects of Joy were steadily pulling the memories back into center stage. \n\nWhen Bruce found out about the girl he had to make a decision about the very fabric of Olathe. He needed to kill the girl. You see, Bruce knew that the appearance of the girl would apart a war all over the world... and though killing the girl.might meant the en for the human race, isn't it what they deserved? They were monster. This is the only way of ending it, not with a war of hatred, bloodshed, and tears, as that would only continue the trend of endless hatred. Even though Bruce hadn't realized, a deep-seeded guilt of his \"actions,\" in the Olathian War followed him like a shadow, a reflection of Bruce himself. He would do anything to break the guilt. Whether it be an odd blue pill that had just been introduced to the outskirts of Olathe, or risking his life to save a world that didn't realise it needed saving. A world that was loveless.\n\nSo, Bruce left his small fishing cabin, the Raccoon he had lived with for so many years following closely behind, on a journey through teeth and nail, to kill the only girl remaining in the world, to end humanity itself.\n\n/-/-/-/-/-/-/\n\nYeah, so I know it's kinda stupid but I wanted somehwere to share it.

Which also means that for a meta report it's going to be a little more fast and loose as we're dealing with a lot of day 1 decks and things can easily change over the coming weeks. So i may miss some decks and such and i would advise some caution about crafting some of them. Anyways here we go !\n\n---\n\n**Forestcraft**\n\nIn the oaken halls of Forestcraft that Greenwoods are on the march as their Guardians can suddenly been seen everywhere with Selwyn joking about a Guardians of the Greenwood movie coming up next though a sharp look from Arisa shuts that joke down fast.. she's still sore about losing her Roaches and seeing Kokkoro bouncing about merrily is apparently reminding Arisa of bouncing her roaches.\n\nFor Forestcraft Greenwood Forest is the new deck on the block though Amataz forest while not as popular seems to be a potent contender in the current meta as well and finally Natura Forest remains as a force to be reckoned with in the meta as well.\n\n[Amataz Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.5zvAY.5zvAY.5zvAY.6lZuM.6lZuM.6lZuM.6KolQ.6KolQ.6KolQ.6pOlw.6pOlw.6pOlw.6tASg.6tASg.6tASg.5zvAi.5zvAi.5zvAi.6pLay.6pLay.6pLay.6pO1C.6pO1C.6pO1C.6tEcS.6tEcS.6tEcS.5zvvQ.5zvvQ.5zvvQ.6pQTI.6pQTI.6pQTI.6ld3A.6ld3A.6ld3A.6pJ8Y.6pJ8Y.6pJ8Y.6t7Hs?lang=en)\n\nAn aggro-combo deck built around Amataz and his flying Circus of Fairies the deck generally aims to either build up a big board and quickly kill the enemy or run them down with lots of Storm followers, it was a potent deck before the expansion and remains so in the new one with Spiritshine taking the role of Fairy circle plus a few new additions in the form of Kokkoro for card draw and Mallet Monkey for extra reach. Beyond that not much has changed as such with the deck and it remains a formiddable opponent.\n\n[Guardian Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.6lZuM.6lZuM.6lZuM.6t7Hi.6t7Hi.6t7Hi.6KolQ.6KolQ.6KolQ.6t80Q.6t80Q.6t80Q.6t7HY.6t7HY.6t7HY.6t9jo.6t9jo.6t9jo.6tCAC.6tCAC.6tEcS.6tEcS.6tEcS.6pO12.6pO12.6pO12.6t9jy.6t9jy.6t9jy.6tCA2.6tCA2.6tCA2.6lcKI.6lcKI.6tEcI.6tEcI.6tEcI.6pQTc.6hhbQ.6hhbQ?lang=en)\n\nA new deck in the meta with Ultimate Colosseum, an aggressive midrange deck that is built around the Greenwood guardians and generating enough of them to buff them up but also trigger a variety of secondary effects for bigger tempo swings with Lymaga, Forest Champion acting as the finishing move of the deck as you invoke her. A solid deck though lacking some of that raw speed and power of Amataz forest.\n\n[Natura Forset](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.6lZuM.6lZuM.6lZuM.6pMJg.6pMJg.6pMJg.6lXRo.6lXRo.6pJ8s.6pJ8s.6pJ8s.6pLay.6pLay.6pLay.6pO1C.6pO1C.6pO1C.6tEcS.6tEcS.6tEcS.6pO12.6pO12.6pO12.6ld3A.6ld3A.6ld3A.6pQTS.6lcKI.6lcKI.6lcKI.6pQTc.6pQTc.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_cY.6oxSw.6oxSw.6oxSw.6p22y.6p22y?lang=en)\n\nA midrange deck built around Natura cards, while not seen a lot it is harder to say how much people have adapted to the new cards though Kokkoro does seem like a safe bet and some may be trying out Spiritshine, overall a solid deck but a bit on the slower end which in the current environment could make things a bit trickier depending on how things shape up.\n\n---\n\n**Swordcraft**\n\nIn the great halls of Castle Swordcraft the sounds of Swords clashing rings but higher than normal today as suddenly Peccorine is forced to actually use her sword rather than stuff herself with food from the castle Larder like she's been able to for the last 6 months and actually having to work for her food does not seem to agree with her as she gets very angry with her sparring opponents forcing Erika to step in and put her in her place.\n\nFor Swordcraft there seems to be a solid 4 archetypes for the time being, Evolve Sword, Ambush Sword, Levin Evolve and Natura Sword. Machina sword tragically seems to have been left in the dust for now (hopefully to make a comeback one day)\n\n[Evolve Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.6td0o.6td0o.6td0o.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6tY8S.6tY8S.6tY8S.6taaY.6taaY.6taaY.6i6SA.6i6SA.6i6SA.6piHw.6piHw.6pnAQ.6pnAQ.6pnAQ.6eMSy.6eMSy.6eMSy.6pou6.6pou6.6pou6.6td0y.6td0y.6td0y.6iAbo.6iAbo.6iAbo.6taai.6taai.6taai.6poto.6poto.6poto.6i3H2.6i3H2?lang=en)\n\nA decks that been sort of on and off as a control deck but with Ultimate Colosseum has evolved into a aggressive midrange deck that uses the Evolve cards for significant tempo swings with numerous versions even running quickblader for extra aggression with Shizuru in a lot of cases acting as extra reach in the lategame to punch past wards and what not. A solid deck that is favoured by several streamers we'll see how potent it remains but it does seem like a lot of fun.\n\n[Ambush Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.6l--Q.6l--Q.6l--Q.5-Hb2.5-Hb2.5-Hb2.6lwbA.6lwbA.6lwbA.6tYtA.6tYtA.6tYtA.5zW_g.5zW_g.5zW_g.6l74I.6l74I.6l74I.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6i6SA.6i6SA.6i6SA.6pnAQ.6pnAQ.6pnAQ.5-IK4.5-IK4.5-IK4.6lu8w.6lu8w.6lu8w.6l-ky.6i3_w.6i3_w.6i3_w.6so2A.6so2A.6so2A?lang=en)\n\nWhile receiving few new cards Ambush Sword is making a big entrance into the meta thanks to Kuon Rune as Runecraft decks historically do poorly against Ambush Sword and so with Kuon being very prevalent Ambush Sword and Leod are there to ruin its day like a caped hero ruining the day of a villain.A fast tempo deck that  can sneak under a lot of decks it does struggle with wards and ambush counters but that is one reason Acquisition is run to get a quick amulet to buff leod out of range of the most common counters. So if you're tired of Spellboost rune. This is a deck to consider.\n\n[Levin Evolve Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.6td0o.6td0o.6td0o.6ltQ2.6ltQ2.6ltQ2.6pnAa.6pnAa.6pnAa.6lz1Q.6lz1Q.6lz1Q.6lvsS.6lvsS.6lvsS.6ltQC.6ltQC.6ltQC.6piHw.6piHw.6piHw.6td0y.6td0y.6td0y.6taai.6taai.6l-ky.6l-ky.6l-ky.6phZC.6phZC.6phZC.6poto.6poto.6poto.6i3H2.6i3H2.6i3H2.6pnAQ.6pnAQ?lang=en)\n\nSwitching over to an evolve package it is a fast midrange deck still mixing the evolve from Levin with Peccorine, Kagemitsu and Shizuru to wear down the opponent quickly and overcome them. Hard to say which of the two performs better but considering i am seeing more pure evolve over Levin Evolve the argument could be made that Levin evolve is the weaker of the two but still solid.\n\n[Natura Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.6lwbA.6lwbA.6lwbA.6pkkA.6pkkA.6pkkA.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_cY.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6eK0Y.6phZM.6phZM.6phZM.6pj_S.6pj_S.6i6SA.6i6SA.6i6SA.6eMSy.6eMSy.6eMSy.6tViM.6tViM.6tViM.6poty.6poty.6poty.6pj_I.6pj_I.6pj_I.6i3_w.6i3_w.6i3_w.6pmRY.6pmRY.6pmRY.6taaY.6taaY?lang=en)\n\nAn aggressive midrange deck.. like the others built around Natura synergies the addition of Steadfast Samurai and Fox lancer giving the deck even more reach and aggression and putting it ever close to just being a straight up aggro deck to be honest. A potent deck though overall less popular at the moment compared to the evolve decks but not a deck that should be taken lightly i think.\n\n---\n\n**Runecraft**\n\nIn the now rebuilt Academies of Runecraft Isabelle once more wields power supreme.. oblivious to what happened the last few times this has happened and Karyl and Erasmus warnings fall on deaf ears.. as usual as Isabelle is already cackling madly, corrupted by power.. again. It's a tale as old as time. Daria and Cagliostro are already at work rebuilding their shelters and storing necessities.\n\nFor Runecraft Kuon Rune is the new big thing on the block followed by Natura Rune which is now a good deck. No other runecraft decks seem to have appeared, but two very strong decks is nothing to scoff at.\n\n[Kuon Rune](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.3.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.5-gka.5-gka.5-gka.6mLRw.6mLRw.6mLRw.6q4iQ.6q4iQ.6turQ.6turQ.6turQ.6eiR2.6eiR2.6ty_2.6ty_2.6ty_2.6iUNQ.6iUNQ.6iUNQ.6q8sC.6q8sC.6q8sC.6twYy.6twYy.6twYy.5-glM.5-glM.5-glM.6edYi.6edYi.6edYi.6iWaC.6iWaC.6iWaC.6t_RI.6t_RI.6t_RI?lang=en)\n\nA newly introduced Spellboost deck that in many ways plays like the old Daria deck except Kuon is effectively a self contained Daria turn without discarding your hand in the process. It is incredibly popular as it is not only potent.. it's on the cheaper end of the spectrum only requiring one set of legendaries though some versions exist that also tries to include Golem squad for extra golem action. A solid deck it does struggle with faster and more aggressive decks which is where Ambush Sword and other aggressive decks come into play. May see a brief decline as it gets more targeted but will probably bounce back after that.\n\n[Natura Rune](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.3.6so2A.6so2A.6so2A.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.6q78g.6q78g.6q78g.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_cY.6oxSw.6oxSw.6oxSw.6q3zY.6q3zY.6q3zY.6tu6i.6tu6i.6tu6i.6q4iQ.6q4iQ.6q3zi.6q3zi.6q3zi.6q6Po.6q6Po.6q6Po.6q8sC.6q8sC.6t_RS.6t_RS.6t_RS.6qBII.6qBII.6qBII.6q8s2.6q8s2.6q8s2?lang=en)\n\nBack in action proper this time, reborn as a slow midrange deck that scraps the control plan the addition of Aeroementalist and Karyl giving the deck more tempo plays and more control elements and finally simply more reach making for a more formiddable deck overall, some decks are still running the Ginger package for something slower but they are a bit rarer i think.\n\n---\n\n**Dragoncraft**\n\nIn the great caverns of Dragoncraft we find Valdain nursing his wounds as his contest with Gayru very much seemed to go his way leaving Rowen and the rest a bit aghast of another possible 3 months of Natura Dragon and Dinocraft with no sign of real dragons for who knows how long.. Unless.. Rowen decides to scheme a most scheming scheme that will surely result in victory !\n\nFor Dragoncraft Natura dragon remains as the top dog with signs of Aggro dragon making life signs again. Still, better than just having one deck.\n\n[Natura Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.6qVZA.6qVZA.6qVZA.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_ci.6o_ci.6oxSw.6oxSw.6oxSw.6qSOM.6qSOM.6qSOM.6uNro.6uNro.6uNro.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.6qUqS.6qUqS.6qUqS.6qZiy.6qZiy.6qZiy.6p22o.6p22o.6p22o.6qZj6.6qZj6.6qZj6.6uLPi.6uLPi.6uLPi.6uNry.6uNry.6uNry.6mla6.6mla6?lang=en)\n\nA ramp deck built around Natura synergies while the deck is strong it did take some serious hits with Disdainful rending and Masamune rotating out leaving a notably weaker deck.. though obviously still strong, just without some of those ridiculous one two punches it could pull off before. Overall it still tries to ramp ahead and kill the enemy with Valdain but it is starting to include more tools to help close out the game in other ways to help with certain matchups, the aggressive return of Ambush sword is probably not helping the situation either.\n\n[Aggro Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.5zWm2.5zWm2.5zWm2.6qXGi.6qXGi.6qXGi.6l6b2.6l6b2.6l6b2.6iq62.6iq62.6iq62.6ixQy.6ixQy.6ixQy.6meF2.6meF2.6meF2.6uIzc.6uIzc.6uIzc.6uLPi.6uLPi.6uLPi.6uNro.6uNro.6uNro.6mghS.6mghS.6mghS.6uIzI.6uIzI.6uIzI.6ixQo.6ixQo.6qZio.6qZio.6qZio.6e_zM.6e_zM?lang=en)\n\nAn aggro deck that utilizes a mixture of highly aggressive small followers combined with some bigger storm followers Ultimate Colosseum has given it plenty of tools for aggression to make it a bit relevant again plus the arrival of Kuon probably doesn't hurt either though overall the deck still seems to be struggling a bit, we'll see what happens over the coming weeks and if it makes any improvements.\n\n---\n\n**Shadowcraft**\n\nIn the great Catacomb of Shadowcraft the place is overflowing with foxes leaving Cerberus busy to chase after them, barking wildly as she goes off in the darkness. Meanwhile Luna has found a new friend in Shuten-Doji, she thinks he's got a great laugh and he works so well with many of other Lunas friends. Mordecai is starting to feel a bit left behind because of that though.\n\nFor Shadowcraft Ginsetsu shadow is taking to the front as a new deck followed by Natura Shadow.. with a splash of Ginsetsu. For a total of 2 decks.\n\n[Ginsetsu Shadow](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.5.6ujq2.6ujq2.6ujq2.6ufgQ.6ufgQ.6ufgQ.6dZBY.6dZBY.6dZBY.6n5YC.6n5YC.6n5YC.6qy7c.6qy7c.6qy7c.6uexi.6uexi.6uexi.6uhNo.6uhNo.6fP6Q.6fP6Q.6fP6Q.6qvh2.6qvh2.6qvh2.6uhNy.6uhNy.6uhNy.6ujqC.6ujqC.6ujqC.6umGS.6umGS.6jJrI.6jJrI.6jJrI.6umGI.6umGI.6umGI?lang=en)\n\nA slower Midrange shadow deck that has made its appearance in Ultimate Colosseum built around Ginsetsu and Shuten-Doji for a more controlling midrange deck that relies on a mix of control elements and lategame burst with Ginsetsu being the star of that particular show though in a pinch she can also just flood the board with 1/3 wards with rush to buy time. Overall a solid deck.\n\n[Natura Shadow](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.5.6qtEy.6qtzg.6qtzg.6qtzg.6ufgQ.6ufgQ.6ufgQ.6oxSw.6oxSw.6oxSw.6n5YC.6n5YC.6n5YC.6qqos.6qqos.6qqos.6qy7S.6qy7S.6qy7c.6qy7c.6qy7c.6fP6Q.6fP6Q.6uhNy.6uhNy.6uhNy.6ujqC.6ujqC.6ujqC.6jJrI.6jJrI.6jJrI.6qy7I.6qy7I.6qy7I.6umGI.6umGI.6umGI.6qtEy.6qy7S?lang=en)\n\nA slow midrange deck built around Natura synergies, the addition of Ginsetsu and Shuten-doji comes to the surprise of no one really as they are great fits for what the deck does and synergizes nicely with night of the living dog and overall just gives the deck more control tools and more reach giving the deck a serious boost it was previously lacking during verdant conflict. So if you liked Natura shadow before, rest assured, it is stronger.\n\n---\n\n**Bloodcraft**\n\nIn the great bloodsoaked manor of Bloodcraft things got even more soaked in blood as suddenly a thousand crazed berserkers fell upon the place and set up camp leaving Urias quite confused.. and even more confused when Lucius the vampire hunter sets up shop as well.. Urias can't help but ask Lucius if he didn't get the wrong address and meant to head to Swordcrafts Castle.. but no apparently.. Vampire slayer means he is slaying FOR the vampires and not slaying them.. which also explains all the Dragon slayers in Dragoncraft when you think about.. Urias admits it makes sense and decides not to think more about it.\n\nFor Bloodcraft Pain Blood is first into the fray followed by Aggro Blood.\n\n[Pain Blood](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.6v3oc.6rGOA.6rGOA.6rGOA.6v6zQ.6v6zQ.6v6zQ.6o_cY.6o_cY.6rDDM.6rDDM.6rDDM.6v1MC.6v1MC.6v1MC.6v3oI.6v3oI.6v3oI.6v6EY.6v6EY.6v6EY.6v8gy.6v8gy.6v8gy.6jgYQ.6jgYQ.6jgYQ.6nR_Y.6nR_Y.6nR_Y.6v8go.6v8go.6v8go.6rI5s.6rI5s.6rI5s.6rKXy.6rKXy.6v3oc.6v3oc?lang=en)\n\nPain blood seems to a be a mix of Natura blood and Pain blood for a slower midrange deck that can present some tempo swings and some powerful AoE options with Aragavy though it doesn't see a ton of usage atm, we'll see how things develop with Pain blood as it could try to get even faster.\n\n[Aggro Blood](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.5zWm2.5zWm2.5zWm2.6v3oc.6v3oc.6v3oc.6frgY.6frgY.6frgY.6jdNI.6jdNI.6jdNI.6nP4M.6nP4M.6nP4M.6v1M2.5_p-4.5_p-4.5_p-4.6nWOy.6nWOy.6nWOy.6rKY6.6rKY6.6rKY6.6jgYQ.6jgYQ.6jgYQ.6fu76.6fu76.6fu76.6rFfI.6rFfI.6rFfI.6rI5s.6rI5s.6rI5s.6jfpi.6jfpi.6jfpi?lang=en)\n\nThe old school aggro deck, the addition of Lucius and Rookie Succubus being big helps for the deck as it gets a goblin with an upside and a goblin that summons a bat giving the deck a stronger and more consistent start and also helps play into other tools, also a couple of lists do run Kudlak as a tempo threat to help push forward with as well and most do seem to be running Imp lancer though not this list from Gamewith. Overall a deck with plenty of potential with Rune out in force as it is and we'll see if it may not grow in numbers and strength.\n\n---\n\n**Havencraft**\n\nIn the sacred Basillicas of Havencraft the sounds of prayer ring harder once more as Elana is finally able to at least partially drive Garuda and his angry birds out of the sacred Church of Havencraft and get some more room thanks to the intervention of Wilbert and his Holy Knights .. meanwhile Eris just wonders where all of this will end up at this rate.\n\nFor Havencraft Elana Ward Haven has taken up the mantle of lead havencraft deck and defender of the faith followed by Natura Haven. So still two decks really. \n\n[Elana Ward Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.6nssI.6nssI.6nssI.6hISM.6hISM.6hISM.6l6b2.6l6b2.6l6b2.6j_ny.6j_ny.6j_ny.6npwo.6npwo.6npwo.6vPmY.6vPmY.6vPmY.6jzLY.6jzLY.6jzLY.6k4gI.6k4gI.6k4gI.6rg_I.6rg_I.6k4gS.6k4gS.6nsN2.6nsN2.6nsN2.6nupS.6nupS.6nupS.6vX5I.6vX5I.6vX5I.6k4gS.6k2E2.6k2E2?lang=en)\n\nA mix of the new Ward archetype and Elana haven the deck makes use of all the bodies the other deck generates, in particular in a manner that makes it easier for Elana to heal them to make lots of big holy cavaliers and run the enemy down with them, all backed up by our good old friend Kel. A solid deck though a bit on the slower end and it does have its struggles it seems. We'll see how it handles over the coming weeks.\n\n[Natura Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.6reog.6reog.6reog.6nssI.6nssI.6nssI.6rc6o.6rc6o.6rc6o.6o_cY.6o_cY.6o_cY.6oxSw.6oxSw.6oxSw.6rbds.6rbds.6rbds.6re3y.6re3y.6re3y.6owk2.6owk2.6owk2.6nsN2.6nsN2.6nsN2.6riyI.6riyI.6riyI.6vX5I.6vX5I.6vX5I.6riyc.6riyc.6riyc.6rgWC.6rgWC.6rgWC.6ssBo?lang=en)\n\nThe same faster Midrange deck built around Natura synergies it has quickly adopted Wilbert the Grand Knight as well along with Athena for some extra lategame ward action shenanigans to give it another extra way of closing out the game, but it does struggle a bit in terms of power level in certain matchups due to the increase in wards so while still a good deck it may find itself with a harder time, admittedly things are still early and the deck could change in a lot of ways to make it stronger. So we'll see where it goes\n\n---\n\n**Portalcraft**\n\nIn the swirling suburbanite madness of Portalcraft we find everyone working out and pumping iron.. Except for Yuwan who thinks its all a bit silly and prefers to play with his puppets and artifacts rather than all of this nonsense working out.. and he's starting to get sick of hearing \"Onegai Muscle\" on repeat for the 500th time..\n\nFor Portalcraft Muscle Portal is the main deck for now with Artifact portal seemingly sticking about as well in some form or the other.\n\n[Muscle Portal](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.8.6vovw.6vovw.6vovw.6voB2.6voB2.6voB2.6vqdI.6vqdI.6vqdI.6s2wi.6s2wi.6s2wi.6vt3Y.6vt3Y.6vt3Y.6s65g.6s65g.6s65g.6voBC.6voBC.6voBC.6vvVo.6vvVo.6vvVo.6vqdS.6vqdS.6vqdS.6vvVy.6vvVy.6vvVy.6o_ci.6o_ci.6o_ci.6sp_A.6p22y.6p22y.6p22y.6o9vC.6o9vC.6o9vC?lang=en)\n\nA new deck in the meta built around Karula and his muscleheads and preserving PP, the deck is an interesting one and seems to be a slow midrange deck with a stronger slant towards control as it generates very little tempo and can unless it pulls correctly struggle against faster decks though at the same time can shut them down quickly with the right hand as well. Overall while it is somewhat popular it does seem to be struggling to make a mark indicating that it may need some refinement and improvement. \n\n[Artifact Portal](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.8.6kRNQ.6kRNQ.6kRNQ.6o_ci.6o_ci.60a4-.60a4-.60a4-.6o9v2.6o9v2.6o9v2.6s2wi.6s2wi.6s2wi.6s3fQ.6s3fQ.6s3fQ.6ga3S.6ga3S.6ga3S.6kOCS.6kOCS.6kOCS.6oHDo.6oHDo.6oHDo.6r-22.6r-22.6kT4y.6kT4y.6kOCI.6kOCI.6kOCI.6gcVs.6gcVs.6gcVs.6vvVy.6oCLS.6oCLS.6oCLS?lang=en)\n\nThe same artifact based midrange deck we all know and love, it has made a few additions, mostly the addition of Kaiser as an extra way to look for Artifacts, beyond that not much else has changed and i imagine that while the deck works it does struggle somewhat in the meta. We'll see if it can't find a way through this meta.\n\n---\n\nSo there you have it, obviously none of this stuff is super certain at this stage and hopefully we see more decks arrive in the coming weeks as people try out more things. But at least for the most part now it would seem like most classes have received at least 1 new deck with others getting strengthened. So it is looking like an optimistic start and hopefully no deck grows wildly out of control this time around.. That would be very nice in my opinion.\n\nIn the meanwhile try out new things, experiment with decks and see if you can find something that works for you, heavens knows i am trying with Machina Sword with mixed results for now. Also a fun side fact, but today is my birthday ! So yay me !\n\nBut until next week, have fun playing Shadowverse !", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:18+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:20+00:00", "subreddit": "Shadowverse", "subreddit_id": "t5_3c35m", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.Shadowverse", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 55, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Shadowverse/comments/eh8m06/shadowverse_rotation_meta_report_december_29th/"}

Could I get a critique on my first draft solar diagram? There is so much info out there and I\u2019ve been reading for weeks - hoping I\u2019m getting close to the right idea.\n\nAll tips are welcome! Here are some specific questions I had:\n\nThe 15A in line fuse between the panel and the charge controller is what was recommended to me by Renogy, but I\u2019ve read elsewhere that a circuit breaker (25a?) would be best because I\u2019d be able to isolate the solar from the battery. Thoughts?\n\nI put a 25A breaker between the charge controller and the positive busbar, but my Renogy kit came with a 20A ANL fuse. Thoughts on one vs the other?\n\nI ordered the blue sea main switch that [Faroutride](https://www.facebook.com/faroutride/?ref=gs&amp;__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARDTRIBmvyUAx9pvZO835vo9K65ftY3Imm5GcZIYZaSH4xhUP6oZQ01H4vh6SxVhNL14NLwMnGGYWDeR&amp;fref=gs&amp;dti=1809972795777507&amp;hc_location=group) recommended. Are you supposed to size on/off switches the same way you do fuses etc? If so, is this one appropriate for my system? This is the 350A e-series battery switch.\n\nAlso, I did not put a fuse between the on/off switch and the battery. Do I need one?\n\nWhat safety measure goes between the positive bus bar and the inverter? Far Out Ride has a terminal fuse but I\u2019m a little unsure about why and sizing.\n\nAlso a note, I have not sized wires yet. My solar kit came with 10 awg cables that I think gets me set up to the battery, then I\u2019m on my own after that.\n\nThank you all for your help! Even if you don\u2019t respond to this post directly, this group has been such a huge source of information and inspiration.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/funf1h7jxl741.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4c23ea49d7d5e18cef394c5a5ab704620367a4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p79tuh7jxl741.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c59865d71bf47136b148bacf52e2897bc2583d9", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:28:17+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:18+00:00", "subreddit": "vandwellers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rnwo", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.vandwellers", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 10, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/vandwellers/comments/eh8lzo/solar_diagram_first_draft/"}

They literally had hundreds of cars that matched my requirements, and were in much better condition than the CPO cars at the dealerships. After spending days searching, I found my dream car, filed all the paperwork and received my car a couple of days ago.\n\nThe car itself was in great condition. There was a minor scratch on it that wasn't mentioned in the listing. I contacted Carvana and they offered me a $100 refund right away!\n\nAll in all, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase for Carvana! I would tell those who are interested in also buying a car from them, to really compare the cars carefully, as each car comes with its own set of options and features. Also, if you want to finance the car, you will need either 2 recent paystubs or a job offer letter and 1 paystub. You will also need to get full coverage auto insurance if you're financing the car.\n\nIf you have any questions, or need a referral code, don't hesitate to ask!", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:27:59+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:28:00+00:00", "subreddit": "carvana", "subreddit_id": "t5_39v82", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.carvana", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/carvana/comments/eh8lu4/recent_carvana_purchase/"}

You meet someone, you get your hopes up, you\u2019re happy and then it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s hard, I feel my heart breaking a little each time it happens. I\u2019m someone that gets exited easily, and I am scared of becoming jaded.\nI never really dated before this year. I was used of a guy pursuing me and then automatically being together. But dating is hard, you never know where you stand, you can\u2019t fully be yourself, give affection etc. You feel like you\u2019re being taken for a test drive and that\u2019s the opposite of feeling secure. I started dating more seriously this year because I often ended up with guys I didn\u2019t like that much, but who had pursued me. So I figured I would take control of my dating life to end up with someone I liked. But man this is hard for someone like me. I had so much deceptions this year. My problem is that I overlook things when I like someone. I think my filter is not right. I think: oh this guys is nice, he does all those things for me, who cares if he asks me on last minute dates even if I hate it ? And then I\u2019m resentful because he tells me I don\u2019t make enough effort and I should also do the pursuing. I am doing something wrong. I think I am needy, in my heart I need so much love and affection from someone. I never show that I am needy, but that\u2019s one of the reason why I need guys to take the first steps, because otherwise how will I know if he REALLY likes me or just like spending time with me because I am good company and pretty? I want to stop dating altogether but I\u2019m the other hand I am so needy and I need someone to love me. I am so lost and this dating thing makes me lose myself more. Should I stop dating apps, dating altogether? I am 27,5 y/o and I feel like I am running out of time. Maybe I should just resign, get some cats, and just come to terms with the idea that love doesn\u2019t exist and that I shouldn\u2019t trust anyone with my heart. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate some tips from women dating, how do you protect your heart ?\n\n\u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:27:58+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:27:59+00:00", "subreddit": "RedPillWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xing", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.RedPillWomen", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 78, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/RedPillWomen/comments/eh8ltr/tired_of_dating_rant/"}

I can offer some things in return for the game, which total more than the game is worth.\n\nWhy I want it- Modern Warfare is critically acclaimed and is by far the best title in the series. My friends said they weren't going to get it , and we were happy on other games. Lo and behold, all 3 get it for Christmas. My family doesn't celebrate anything, and my birthday is a summer month, so I can't even ask for it then. I swim alongside school, so my parents won't let me get a job yet.\n\nA little bit about the game- With a campaign and astounding graphics, The latest addition to the COD franchise hits the nail on the head with fast paced multiplayer and realistic weapons. All the way from steam and gas to different reloads depending on your ammo quantity, the levels of realism are great. Cross-platform has finally been introduced, allowing all players to play with their friends on Xbox, PS4 , and PC.\n\nIn return for the game, I can offer 25$ Steam (CSGO Skins will be traded totaled 25$). I can also throw in an AMC gift card for the theatre (15$). If you really want it, I can give up a Starbucks gift card (5$). This is all I have and I'm willing to give it up for this. The game is 40$, so I guess you would make 5 from this.\n\n RedSpectre#11604 is my blizzard account.\n\n [https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/call-of-duty-mw](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/call-of-duty-mw) \n\nI would say happy holidays but that's it's too late for that.

She suggested that I could radically change my perspective of life by thinking different thoughts.  \n\n\n[Money Affirmations](https://preview.redd.it/pfux1ghxwl741.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31118609cf24de501fc6f52d75d3e79758360ac6)\n\nUntil that moment, I had not heard about [money affirmations](https://www.thelawofattractionss.com/2019/12/money-affirmations.html) or mantras, so I was skeptical. My logical mind simply could not connect by saying a few words and having a transformation of life. But he was willing to try it. You see, I was unhappy. I wanted something different I felt trapped and unsure of how to get it. So, I said I would try them.\n\nI began to see that as I used **money affirmations**, my life was changing. At first, the changes were subtle, but they were there. Gradually, over time, I found myself changing in ways I had never expected, but most importantly, I found myself full of confidence, hope, and joy! I found the confidence to leave my figure and jump into being an entrepreneur.\u00a0\n\nI found myself knowing that I could create whatever I wanted for my life and that filled me with hope. And a big one here ... I discovered that I was no longer a \"half empty\" girl. I started to see the good in everything. That led to much more happiness! Did the use of **money affirmations** do all that? I think.\n\n**Let's go back a moment and see the statements from a logical perspective.**\n\nThe dictionary defines the statement in this way:\n\n\u2022 The action or process of affirming something or being affirmed\n\n\u2022 Emotional support or encouragement\n\n\u2022 Let's go one step further. What does affirming mean? It means to declare as a fact: affirm strongly and publicly.\n\nWe are declaring something strongly and publicly. This statement provides emotional support and encouragement.\n\nThat sounds a bit basic, but sometimes I find it useful to go back to the definition of the word and look at things without all the \"courtship\" and the noise there is.\n\nWhy do we need something like affirmations? I want you to consider the statement, \"you are what you think.\" Let's go a little further and think about our bank balance. Is our money a reflection of what we think? Are we creating the amount of money we have with our thoughts?\n\nHow can our thoughts shape our lives? Is it an invisible power that kidnaps our thoughts and then creates our life? No, it is not. However, it is something invisible. It is our subconscious. You see, the subconscious cannot identify the facts of fiction. If you feed on a fictional diet, you think fiction.\u00a0\n\nTake things as they are expressed literally and do not filter other meanings of words. The fun of the subconscious is that it wants to protect us. So, if you believe in a fiction, then you will do everything in your power to make sure the fiction is true.\n\nIt works the same with money. The things we hear begin to be programmed in our subconscious. For example, we could be programmed to believe things like: money is scarce, money comes only from hard work, money is bad or not everyone can have money.\u00a0", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:27:46+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:27:48+00:00", "subreddit": "u_lawofattractionss", "subreddit_id": "t5_29kt88", "subreddit_type": "user", "domain": "self.lawofattractionss", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/u_lawofattractionss/comments/eh8lqw/how_to_use_more_money_affirmations/"}

I don't exactly care that I'm always the last one to finish a workout and whatnot, but I guess I'm looking to hear from people who struggled to get form in the beginning and are now doing great.

With some further searching I found the 'official' TorBirdy webpage at:\n\n[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy) This webpage states,\n\n\"Current TorBirdy version is 0.2.6 released on 06 Oct 2018.\"\n\n[https://dist.torproject.org/torbirdy/](https://dist.torproject.org/torbirdy/) reports TorBirdy was last modified on 2018-10-06 at 17:20. If TorBirdy is no longer being developed, shouldn't this be stated on the Tor Project's 'official' TorBirdy webpage at: [https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy)\n\nWith just a cursory search I've found guides written by third-parties as recently as September 2019, advising how to set up Thunderbird with TorBirdy: \n\n[https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/How+to+use+Thunderbird+with+Tor+Onion+Router](https://kb.mailbox.org/display/MBOKBEN/How+to+use+Thunderbird+with+Tor+Onion+Router)\n\nThe 'official' TorBirdy website states, in the 'Status' section \"TorBirdy is in beta and should be considered experimental. Please make sure that you read the Before using TorBirdy section below before using it for the first time.\"\n\nThis suggests it was/is in a process of development but seemingly no new releases since 2018-10-06? \n\n[https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy](https://github.com/ioerror/torbirdy) reports \"Latest commit de52ae9 on Jun 20, 2016\"\n\nI've tried searching for evidence of any current or previous development of TorBirdy since the last official release &amp; found nothing, including any possible forks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, my question: Is TorBirdy Dead or Alive?**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf TorBirdy is no longer being developed either permanently or development is on an extended hiatus, shouldn't this be stated on the official Tor Project TorBirdy webpage?\n\nFor me it's just the principle of clear, transparent communication providing an accurate &amp; reliable overview of the status of a given Tor-related software development project. \n\n**For novices not necessarily technically knowledgeable &amp; living in countries where they really need to rely on Tor, clear accurate information regarding the suitability of the use of certain software could well be an imperative with very tangible, negative outcomes for the Tor user. The need for clear communication is also essential considering English might not be that Tor user's mother-tongue language.**   \n\nThe presence of links on the official Tor Project website to download the TorBirdy software could be misconstrued by some Tor users as meaning this particular software is in some way endorsed or approved by the Tor Project for current use, by virtue of it's inclusion on the official Tor Project website - without any clear communication on the website about whether this project is no longer in active development &amp; therefore less safe than any other potentially unsafe software, currently in active development. \n\nIt would seem only more recent versions of Thunderbird are no longer compatible with TorBirdy but how many people have downloaded &amp; used or even continue to use the TorBirdy add-on, when TorBirdy might in fact be out of date &amp; therefore quite simply **not safe to use** even though it might appear to be functioning without any issues?\n\nWhilst I realise Ricochet is not in any way an 'official' Tor project software it's another example of this poor communication, with the last stable release on 1.1.4 November 7, 2016 &amp; once again no clear statement on the Ricochet website to provide a 'current status' on the project. This might cause some to think it's 'O.K' to use this software. \n\nRicochet's GitHub page reports \"Latest commit a22c729 on Aug 16, 2017\" \n\nRicochet's [https://ricochet.im/releases/](https://ricochet.im/releases/) reports latest 08-Nov-2016 04:48 - again dead or alive?  \n\nAlso, clear &amp; official statements regarding the development status of any Tor-related software might help prevent third-parties from providing guides on using this software when it might very well no longer be in active development.  \n\nIn conclusion, these are observations I hope will assist &amp; not criticisms.  \n\nI fully understand &amp; appreciate the Tor Project has many responsibilities. \n\nMy primary incentive for raising these issues are for the safety &amp; accurate understanding of Tor users the world over.

My former long-distance girlfriend and I recently broke up on amicable terms. The initial part of the breakup was rough, but we called and talked it out and successfully ended things on a positive note.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m struggling with. We were originally going to wait until the end of my winter break (which is in about three weeks) to decide whether to break up or not, but our relationship had become very rocky over the past few months or so. Ending it now was hard, but it was definitely the best for both of us, and now that it is over I\u2019m not hurting too much over our past. However, I still somewhat feel regretful that we basically lost the opportunity to spend time physically together while I'm back for break. \n\nWhat I mean is, since we were in long distance, being back together was rare and now that we have broken up, I feel like that time we could've spent together (e.g. going on dates, taking a day trip to the city.) I also feel like we'll miss out on sex, which was sort of my expectation when I came back. I guess I'm the type of person to feel regretful over lost opportunities. I\u2019ll admit I suggested to her the idea of ending our official boyfriend-girlfriend commitment but still having sex. (I know, probably a bad idea to begin with since we\u2019re supposed to be seeing each other less to move on!!) Neither of us are going to see anyone new for now, hookup- or relationship-wise, and I knew she enjoyed our sex. She said no firmly to that, and of course I\u2019m going to respect that decision. \n\nBut for me, it\u2019s a little sad to think that even though sex was fun, we won\u2019t have it again. And again, I had the previous expectation that we\u2019d be having sex when I was back for break and it drove my horniness up. I do know about apps like Tinder, but those hookups lack the intimacy that is present in a relationship. Based on research-backed stuff I've read about, sex with someone you're close with feels much better than a one-night stand or something like that. So even though I could have sex when I go back to college, it won't be with someone I've committed to like I did with my girlfriend. Even though she lacked sexual skill to say the least, I do miss that intimacy and feeling of being inside and holding in my arms someone I was so close to. It'll be a while before I get back into a serious, long-term relationship and be able to have that kind of sexual experience again. To be honest I feel pretty immature writing this, and I don't want to have the attitude of solely wanting her to \"use\" her for sex (like I said, I do feel remorseful we couldn't have gone out on dates, etc.) But, I miss it. So, what ways would you recommend to me to get over this conflicted feeling that even though I know it\u2019s 100% best that we\u2019re broken up, I\u2019m still regretful we couldn\u2019t spend more time and have sex over break?", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:27:31+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:27:32+00:00", "subreddit": "sex", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.sex", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/sex/comments/eh8ln1/how_do_i_stop_missing_sex_with_my_exgirlfriend/"}

It's only a cosmetic issue though, I'll try fixing that soon-ish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, While I have tested the build on tactical, I haven't actually tested it on a real campaign. It might be unstable and prone to crashing so just in case make a backup save before you play with it.\n\n**Remember, This build is not official and is meant mostly testing purposes. Treat it as a \"base\" of the chosen integration, with everything being prone to serious iteration.** \n\nPatch Notes:\n\n**Knowledge gain changes:**\n\n* Decreased Retribution knowledge gain from 15 to 5\n* Increased guaranteed knowledge gain to 5 (from 4)\n* Increased knowledge gain from extract knowledge from 10 to 20\n* Decreased the base kidnap chance to 0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Activity Changes:**\n\nRestructured the way the chosen chose their activities:\n\n* Chosen at knowledge level 0 can only train, and is the lowest activity priority\n* They gain Retribution at knowledge level 1, Additional DE at knowledge level 2, Sabotage at knowledge level 3 and Avenger assault at knowledge level 4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Chosen no longer level their stats up with training. They just get a perk now.\n* Chosen can now train as much as they need to, thus they no longer have a hard limit on perk counts\n* Chosen now level their stats with force level (the FL thresholds are 8/13/17)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Retribution now reduces the supply, intel and recruit job effectiveness by 33% for 21 days instead of it's previous effect (should remind myself to update the localization). The effect stacks multiplicatively\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Filler changes for now, Will come back to that later*\n\n* Sabotage chance increased from 75% to 100%\n* Increased the max datapads  stolen from 2 to 3\n* Increased the additional wound days of some soldiers from 5 to 9 days\n* Increased the elerium core stolen from 1-2 to 3-5\n* Incresed the weapon mod stolen from 1-2 to 3-5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chosen Tactical Changes:**\n\nAll chosen gain prime reactions wit following restrictions:\n\n* They can't trigger on their own turn\n* They  can't extract or kidnap with these\n* They can't summon with these\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rescaled their health to match the rest of the changes**\n\nThese are vanilla values for the chosen: (M1 rookie/vet/comm/leg -&gt; M2 rookie/...) \n\n* Health: 12/15/20/25 -&gt; 18/20/30/35 -&gt; 25/30/40/45 -&gt; 30/35/50/60 \n* Armor:    0/0/0/1 -&gt; 0/0/1/2 -&gt; 0/0/2/3 -&gt; 2/2/3/4\n\nThose Are the current LWOTC values: \n\n* Health: 17/20/35/40 -&gt; 23/35/50/55 -&gt; 30/35/50/60 -&gt; 35/40/90/95\n*  Armor:  0/0/2/3 -&gt; 0/0/3/4 -&gt; 0/0/4/5 -&gt; 2/2/5/6\n\nThe new values:\n\n* Health: 15/17/20/25 -&gt; 20/25/32/40 -&gt; 30/35/45/50 -&gt; 40/45/50/60 \n* Armor: 0/0/0/0 -&gt; 0/0/1/2 -&gt; 1/2/3/4 -&gt; 3/4/5/6  \n \n* Chosen are immune to the frost effect (Placeholder-ish, will likely get changed should frost bomb be rebalanced)\n* Rescaled chosen weapon damage to match LW2 values\n* Chosen Primary Weapon attacks now have a -66% damage mod and daze\n* Chosen Secondary Weapon attacks now have a -66% damage mod and Heavy daze\n* Chosen Can no longer be critically hit\n\n**Introducing the Heavy daze Effect**: \n\nActs very similiarly to daze, but:\n\n* It pierces basic mental immunity \n* Its revive costs 1 action\n* Sparks are still immune.\n\n**Rebalanced Strengths and Weaknesses**\n\n* Chosen summoning abilities now have a 4 turn cooldown\n* Removed Planeswalker from the available strength pool\n* Shell shock damage bonus reduced to 33%\n* Brittle Damage bonus reduced to 15%\n* Bewildered Damage bonus reduced to 25%\n* Adversary Damage bonus reduced to 25%\n* Replaced Meele immunity with Meele Resistance, which reduces incoming meele damage by 50%\n* Replaced Blast Shield immunity with a 50% damage resistance\n* Groundling aim bonus increased to 20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AI Changes:**\n\nThe new AI is very heavily based on DerBK's A Better Chosen, with some tweaks there and there\n\nThe biggest difference is the lack of naturally occuring kidnapping for now, and some abilities do stuff differently\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's they are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Assasin:**\n\n* Parting silk now pierces 100 of the target's dodge\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hunter:**\n\n* No longer has bleeding rounds by default\n* Will no longer tracking shot, he'll just hunter rifle shoot you. Keep in mind the negative damage modifier, and the Squadsight long range penalty.\n* Added the ability to teleport to a soldier and extract knowledge from him (can only do that when activated, not when engaged)\n* Will no Longer use tranq shot, as standard pistol fire has pretty much taken over that purpose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Warlock:**\n\n* Added Sabotage Weapon and The Elder's Champion, which act pretty much the same as A better Chosen's\n* Overwhelm mindshield will now Heavy daze rather than deal damage\n* He should now slowly come towards the player, not as fast as the assasin, but no longer stay back like hunter\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoreover, as a bonus I've also included the Full Override nerf, whose patch notes are thus:\n* Fixed the issue where EVAC-ing the mastered mec wouldn't grant the resistance mec.\n* Full Override's Control enemy replaced with Greater Shutdown, which stuns the robotic unit for 3 turns. Greater shutdown has a higher chance to succeed than Control Enemy.\n* Full Override now has a 3 turn Cooldown, same as Haywire\n* Sectopods have a unique variant of \"Master Enemy\" which has a severely reduced success chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Feedback I'm looking for in partucular:\n* How is The chosen health on all difficuilties? Are they easy enough to kill on rookie and veteran, and hard enough to kill on commander and legend?\n* How is the chosen prime reaction behavior? Are they too passive? Are they too agressive?\n* How often do chosen actually gain their captures, and how fast will they get to the avenger defence?\n* And the inevitable bugs, obviously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**DOWNLOAD THE NEW BUILD HERE**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9tutkp178if6ih/lwotc-exp-0001.zip?dl=0)", "created_utc": "2019-12-29T17:27:20+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-29T17:27:21+00:00", "subreddit": "LWotC", "subreddit_id": "t5_7m0h9", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.LWotC", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 11, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/LWotC/comments/eh8lk0/experimental_build_0001_feedback_thread/"}
