I just went through the first 3 months of Highschool, Junior year. Picked tough courses because I wanted to have a \"good future\" and I ended up struggling, but regardless, the amount of stress that I have had was extreme. On a whim, I thought: \"Hey, in a couple of days I'll finish school, maybe life will be significantly better afterward because then I no longer have to stick to a horrible routine and won't be stressed anymore and I'll get to do the things I love!\"\n\nTurns out I was wrong.

I don't mean that in a nihilistic way, but rather, what I mean is: Does it matter if you're average or rich? Does it matter if you have the girl/guy of your dreams? Does it matter if you're driving a fucking sports car? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is this attachment to materialism seemingly the supposed answer to the world's greatest problems? Does it really mean anything?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean there's literally nothing to fucking do in life.

Instead, I started writing about my issues and noticed that there is so much and there is no way I could get a helpful response (actually, I decided to leave it at the end as a P.S.). So I want to hear you opinion on the following: \n\nIn recent months, I've become very paranoid, fearing that I've been mildly mentally disabled and that everyone I know kind of adjusted to that by providing me with an emotional safety net. The paranoia was induced by smoking weed but the fears have been exacerbated while sober over the past months - especially by a few situations which confirm my conspiracy theory.\n\nLong story short, I decided to start visiting the psychotherapist. But this is where I see an even bigger problem. This paranoia seems to be reaching so deep so that I wouldn't even trust a psychologist or my best friend should they reassure me that I merely have typical problems everybody my age goes through and that I am not intellectually inferior in any way.\n\nWhether or not this paranoia is a result of major inferiority complex that set roots during my childhood, the point is I am not sure how I would cope if somebody came up to me and told me with a straight face that I am indeed \"a retard\". I've never thought about suicide but it is something I catch myself thinking about more often recently. And this is the paradox. If I was indeed slow and people knew that I would never be able to live with the harsh reality of having special needs - I dont think anybody would ever tell me the truth for my own life's sake.\n\nSo as a result, I am in this meta-state of feeling mentally disabled and blaming it on my depression, keeping some hope that I would become normal again once I get out of this hole. But right now, I dont really know what to do. **So it is basically a correlation/causation dilemma.**\n\nOne more thing that might be useful for you as a reader - I've been rereading my post several times and rewording it. My speaking skills are atrocious - no matter which language I communicate in (I know 3 fluently and understand 1 pretty well).\n\nP.S. If you want to read my original draft, here it is:\n\nOriginally I wanted to write my life story but I don't really see the point. The gist of it is that I've always been rather introverted, smart in elementary school, socially anxious and autistic-like. I spent most of my teen years playing computer games, suffering from major sleep deprivation for years probably.\n\nBut most importantly (to get to the point of this post), I've always suffered from some kind of **anhedonia** \\- which I think is the main reason for my social isolation. I almost always felt tired and fatigued. I think at the age of 13 or 14, I came across the term **derealization** for the first time. I started suspecting that I am not perceiving life as I should - it felt gray and like a chore - as if everything I did everyday I was doing for someone else or because that was \"what I was supposed to be doing\" and that it wasnt me who was living life but solely my body was and that my consciousness was distantly connected to it. At some point, I thought that I had fried my brain by the extreme computer gaming (we are talking 10 hours+ every single day). \n\nAs a consequence, in my last high-school year, I started to open up to experiences in real life, started going out with friends, drinking, smoking weed. Smoking weed had been a very controversial experience for me, because it kind of helped me get a glimpse of how I imagined \"normal people\" perceived real life - I finally truly enjoyed music, colors, emotions, I could laugh wholeheartedly (often even excessively in a way that might scare other people). Life kind of got on a meaning I lacked otherwise.\n\nThe flip side of that \"plunge into real life\" using weed was major self-doubt. Actually, self-doubt sounds almost harmless. It felt much worse and frightening; like a dark, lurking suspicion about my whole essence as a person and my role within my social circle. It induced doubts about whether the people I considered my friends were just tolerating me or even much worse - that they knew something I did not: that I had mild mental disability and that they felt a sense of responsibility to keep me emotionally stable by giving me an illusion of a normal life. Kind of like the Truman show.\n\nThis frightening feeling always seemed to go away after some time and I stayed away from smoking for quite some time during uni - until I did again a year later and got completely wasted. And I havent recovered several months later. I've become much more aware of situations in which people act in a way that confirms my Truman show conspiracy theory of being babysit and treated like a kid:\n\n* The fact that I cant hold proper conversations bothers me much more than it used to.\n* The fact that I am good at playing the piano but have absolutely 0 creativity. I cant think of anything on my own.\n* The fact that I often misinterpret texts, people and have a very hard time summarizing concepts or opinions.\n* The fact that I sense I should see the world with different eyes - it shouldnt be that dull and boring, right?\n\nAnd what makes all this even harder is the fact that I dont really feel like the same person even a week ago. For some reason, I feel as if every day another \"me\" wakes up and starts to figure out life. I dont think I comprehend the true meaning of my diary entries I've written down a couple of months ago - be it because of poor writing skills (I always sucked at writing in school and even now at uni) or simply because I might not be able to precisely translate the way I feel into words. **There is a huge disconnect between what is going in my head and the real world.**", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T13:45:03+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T13:45:05+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebvz0c/is_my_depression_fucking_up_my_intelligence_or_is/"}

Even if the person in lain is struggling, even if they're at a low point, even if maybe they're not doing all the things they're doing like going to therapy, you are total garbage for making someone who already feels like a burden, hates themselves, needs love and care now more than ever, and is at the lowest point of their lives, feel bad about themselves.\n\nI understand boundaries and I respect them. I understand not being able to be there for that person every waking minute because that's actually just selfish. But I don't understand abandoning someone or making them feel worse about their situation or mental health problems then they already do.\n\nThis rant was brought on because every single fucking time I'm at my worst, every single time I find myself crying to sleep for weeks straight or not sleeping at all, every time the suicidal thoughts come back and things get real bad, EVERY FUCKING TIME I lose all my friends. Usually the girls who I hang out with the most first. And then, when I'm doing better, when I have money again, when I'm my normal, bubbly self who builds everyone up, acts motherly and makes everyone feel happy by just being around me, everyone always tries to flock back. All the \"wE sHoUld HanG oUt I miSs yoUuUu\"s come out of the woodwork. All the \"maybe we can be friends again when you're doing better for yourself\" and \"you're a burden to your friends\" are supposed to be forgotten.\n\nAgain, from the outside I may sound selfish but I really am one of the least selfish people I know. I'm the friend who will drive 5 hours in a snow storm to make sure someone's alright, I'm the friend who defends everyone against toxicity, I'm the friend who's their listening to everyone's every last word while I'm secretly dying inside. So I feel I'm entitled to this one thing, this one bout of selfishness, because I'm tired of people being so fucking fake. I'm tired of friends not truly caring and being alone in my worst state constantly. \n\nIn my 23 years of life, this has happened almost every single time I've become really bad, once in high school when my childhood house foreclosed, once at the beginning of college after ending an abusive relationship and now when I'm having serious family problems and my disabled brother is running out of answers for care.

I've fully recovered physically, but I've been more depressed than I have been in years because now that I'm interacting with people again, I realize that there's something I lack that everyone seems to have. Something I didn't get in my lost years that everyone else seems to have.\n\nIn the past few months I've become closer with a person I've known for about a year, and developed some fairly intense feelings for her. I was so sure she didnt reciprocate, but very suddenly she said that she did and had for some time, so we made plans to go on a date. Then just as suddenly, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, had stuff to figure out, and that we couldn't talk anymore. And well, that fucking hurts. I have a final in eight hours but I cant bring myself to give a shit. She's all I can think about.\n\nI've thought about suicide a lot since I started university.

They make it such an overwhelming impossible task that someone who DOESNT suffer from mental health issues would have a hard time doing it so to expect someone who does is ridiculous..... the last time I had an appt I was in the middle of a bout of agoraphobia so it was a horrifying experience to go but then I got there and was told that the provider cancelled my appointment 3 days before and I wasn\u2019t notified which they shrugged off like it was no big deal .... I didn\u2019t sleep for almost a week going into the appt and then sat in Chicago morning rush hour traffic to get there... so it was a big fucking deal to me. \n\nAnyways my teeth have fallen into a state where I can no longer pretend that they aren\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d.

When it first happened, I was worried and anxious, thought that if I had done something wrong, but then I quickly figured out it was his depression, not him. Since I wanted to be more helpful and supportive to him, I did shit tons of research, read a lot of articles and discussion here on Reddit, bought some books ranging from understanding neuroscience behind depression and anxiety, to more holistic approaches to \u2018ease\u2019 anxiety and depression. Anyway, I don\u2019t judge or belittle the illness just because I did not understand how it feels like.   \n\nThen fast forward to last night, a good friend of mine came over and asked how were things with the guy, I told her about his mental states and her reaction was rather unpleasant. \u2018ugh those people\u2019 she said, \u2018they are just weak, negative, and would not do something to fix the issues\u2019,     \n\nAlthough in complete shock of her viewpoint, but hey, maybe she just did not know much about mental illness so I proceed to give her more information with scientific facts. I explained it is not some excuses for people to stay or act negatively, it is caused by chemical imbalance in the brain similar to any other diseases, like having a broken leg or a kidney failure; you get symptoms from it. However, after the lengthy explanation she still not buying it at all.    \n\n\u2018It\u2019ll take a lot more to convince me\u2019 so she said. I was bummed out from her comments and lack of empathy to those who suffer.

I can remember being laugh as a 10 year old on Christmas morning with actual shit in my pants at my Aunts house.  \n\nMy family used to say I was retarded, useless, and not good for anything except shitting myself.  My parents would just let this happen.  I think I was honestly just a mistake, because they never wanted anything to do with me except abuse me. \n\nWhen I finally went out, made friends, and eventually started partying as a 17 year old - they put me in a treatment facility, cutting off all ties with anybody I knew.  \n\nWhen in family counseling, they would roast into me how much of a nuisance I was to them and how everything was my fault. \n\nMonths after graduating, my only favorite uncle, only favorite grandma both died in the same month.  The month prior, I got a tumor in my knee.  That same month my brother, the only one who pretty much primarily raised me, tried to commit suicide multiple times. \n\nI had over 20 episodes of kidney stones and surgeries from 20-30, recently being diagnosed with a rare gene disorder known as CASr.  I will have to take medicine that will dehydrate me substantially everyday for the rest of my life or suffer a stent in my urethra. \n\nThe only love of my life(5 years) and only real gf I\u2019ve ever had left me for another man.  \n\nI had to drop out of college because of surgeries. \n\nI got injured and will never be able to work my dream job again. \n\nRecently my dog just turned 12 and isn\u2019t doing so well. \n\nI just had to drop $2000 on my car repairs in the last 2 months. \n\nI had to move back in with my sadistic parents, more sadistic then ever, recently due to break up. \n\nI\u2019m in crippling debt from school and hospital bills, my injury does not allow me to make the money I need to surpass this anytime soon. \n\nMy ex-GF is obsessed with letting me know she\u2019s fucking somebody else. \n\nI have not 1 friend nor family member I can trust.  \n\nBut despite all of this, I guess I\u2019ll try again tomorrow.  This time I\u2019ll come at it different, this time I\u2019ll know I\u2019m going to fail inevitably. \n\nAnd it\u2019s going to be all be OK, there was never a shred of hope in my life to begin with.  And tomorrow I will expect nothing less, going back *home* to my parents basement defeated and worthless. \n\nI\u2019ll go back again tomorrow, I can see pain on a person from a mile away.  I know it with every sensor, I know exactly how to comfort them.  How to make them feel loved.  If it wasn\u2019t for the two long dead relatives who showed me their compassion, I might not be *this*.  \n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll have 7 texts from 7 different people, all waiting to dump their emotions, sorrows, and struggles apathetically towards me.  Lord knows not 1 of them will ever to do it for me. \n\nBut I\u2019ll help them anyways, because I never want anybody to experience the true depth of loss for which I\u2019ve felt my entire life. \n\nI will wake up and physically push my body to the limits, until there is nothing left.  To do anything less would mean to feel again. \n\nFor me, to feel anything at all anymore is a death sentence.\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for my shitty job that I put in overtime to not even make my bills every month.  \n\nIt consumes me and makes me forget.  Everybody around me is pissed off and ready to go live their happy lives outside of this shithole. \n\nI\u2019m sad to leave.  I will face m reality once more when I get back *home*. \n\nMy past was dark, future darker.  But now, well, I\u2019m tired.  Too tired to think, only ramble off a bit before my next shift.  \n\nWhich I will go into working as hard and precise as I can, making considerable progress, and my coworker who does nothing all day will continue to receive the raises and promotions. \n\nI will go into work dead tired, doing laps around 3 fully rested, terrible mood coworkers.  \n\nI will congratulate them on how well they did. \n\nI give this to you, my dear reader: \n\nI feel like my life has been the most intense training session ever.  Because the very few times the fog has cleared, I\u2019ve found little to no competitors worthy of what I set my goals in. \n\nSo much pain and heartbreak, never catching a break.  \n\nMy family is absolutely terrified of me.  Not that I\u2019m terrorizing them on purpose.. they simply cannot fathom the smile on my face that drives them back into their shells.  The confidence they created from telling me I\u2019m worthless my entire life.  \n\n But most of all, my adept ability to see **true pain** from almost anything - a fake laugh, an ego, an aggressive attitude. \n\nI feel invincible sometimes, and it\u2019s my vulnerability that has allowed this. \n\nNow, fuck me if I can\u2019t catch a break here soon.  \n\nfin.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T11:06:40+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T11:06:41+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebuhgi/a_life_of_misery_and_the_blank_shell/"}

Why have kids if you won\u2019t care for them? Why do you constantly lie? Why do you make promises you can\u2019t keep? Why won\u2019t you be the dad that raised me to be kind and love one another? Why?\n\nHonestly, I could go on and on, but I\u2019d have a book then. I miss my dad, he died several years ago when he stopped pastoring his church. Since then, another man has took my father's body and made life harder everyday since. Some of my earliest memories are of him yelling in my face with his full drill voice. When he punished me, it was way worse. He would take me to a dark room because I was terrified of the dark, and he knew that. So he would whoop me in the dark, just to make sure that my punishment was good enough in his eyes. I am now 18 and still scared of the dark because of those mental scars.\u00a0\n\nI understand that this is the past and I should let it go, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to let go or forgive him for this, mainly because I never got an apology. My dad has a problem owning up to his actions, he\u2019ll find a way to turn it back on you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry it came off that way\u201d. I thought maybe one day he would see what I do, feel the way I do. I\u2019m still waiting.\n\nSometimes, I blame my dad\u2019s growing up. He was born in 1961, Which means he was raised in a rough time period. A lot of racism, sexism, and homophobia, was around during that time. Not to mention, the Vietnam war had just started. He didn\u2019t really have a stable father figure, men came and went, most of them were in the military, so they weren\u2019t around much. He was raised Strictly catholic, so you think he would grow up to be a respectful man right? Well not exactly.\n\nMy dad fell into the wrong crowd. He started using drugs and becoming someone he didn't even recognize. One day he went too far and became aggressive. He and his girlfriend were having a fight, my dad want to have sex, she did not. So he forced her into his car and drove off with her. She pressed charges for Kidnapping and rape. The rape charges were pled down to aggervated asssualt, he was going to serve 8 years and 6 months total. During his time in prison he converted to christaninty for the promise of always being forgiven for his sins. Around the 5 year mark of his sentence he was let go on good behavior.\n\nNow imagine, you are googling people you know of and your curious about your dad so you google his name and find out your dad was put in prison for kidnapping and raping someone. I felt betrayed, I\u2019ve always asked him if he ever went to jail or prison and he lied straight to my face. Still don\u2019t feel right about it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt's not over, skip forward a bit to my mom and dad\u2019s marriage. My mom had her own hardships in the past but was forthcoming with it, mom and I never had secrets. That\u2019s why I knew that there was something wrong when she started shutting me out. I would hear her crying in her room softly, but she would never admit it. What I didn\u2019t know, my dad had sent a text to her, that wasn\u2019t meant for her. He was cheating on my mom and it wrecked her. She gained weight from comfort eating, red puffy eyes from crying all the time. She decided to stay with him because of me, and I wish I would have known cause would have told her to leave him.\n\nMy mom suffered in silence for years, because he figured he could keep doing it and get away with it because my mom wouldn't leave him. One day, my mom had enough and made him leave. I still didn\u2019t know why, so naturally I missed my dad and asked my mom if we could move to him. So we did, and he continued to cheat there too. We moved again, but mom had enough and she divorced him.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we were free, or so I thought. It\u2019s been 6 years since the divorce and he only visits one weekend out of the month.\u00a0 Which Is fine, except for the fact that each one is hell because he thinks about himself which starts drama. Then the next three weeks are spent healing from that weekend. Then he comes back and does the same thing.\n\nAn Idea was presented. He wanted to talk like adults and try to mend what happened in the past, but his one condition is what set me off. His condition was after the\u201dmeeting\u201d and he apologized properly the past can no longer be brought up. That\u2019s When I figured out he only wants this over, nothing he would say would be sincere. So I refused.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s gotten away with so much more, I refuse to let him get away with this.\u00a0\n\nToday is Sunday, December 1, 2019, and I\u2019m still waiting.\u00a0 \u00a0", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T10:53:13+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T10:53:13+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebuda4/i_wrote_this_while_having_a_panic_attack_because/"}

It's something that nobody can see it but I can feel it all the time and it really sucks. And the feeling is like my head is cutted in half, just because of that deformation on the right side. It really makes me sad because when I focus on the left side of my head I can feel how smooth it is, like heaven. And then I just realise how much worse the right part is.\n\nWell I guess you may think this is nothing and I should just not think so much and get over it, but I really can't do it because my life has been so empty, depressing and I REALLY can't feel good around people, I've tried it a lot of times.\n\nYesterday I went out with some friends and I was always that kind of guy that never accepts to go out and all of that simply because I know I won't like it... but at the same time it's still better than being at home all day alone. So I just went with them and sometimes I think to myself how can they just be so happy and laugh and so crative talking feeling this confortable and all. We were 4 and they were all laughing jumping around having fun man, and I was like pushing myself to laugh as well for 8 hours straight, feeling like shit inside and also my head so fucked up. I really can't have emotions so when I'm like trying to be funny or I have some funny story in my head, most of the times I just stay quiet because I can't explain it with emotion and then I know it will be a complete mess. \n\nI'm also virgin, never had a girlfriend and sex in my life, currently with 23 years old. I've been thinking on having a girlfriend many times but I know she wouldn't like me. I just know it because I also wouldnt like her too... Having this idea to have a girlfriend just to finally have one is just stupid. So I'd rather stay alone until I'm finally cured.\n\nI also don't have good friends, I do have like some friends that are good people of course. But we are not much together because they know I don't like to be with them so much. And when we are together our conversations are so boring because my life is boring overall. I have nothing to say and no will too.\n\nSome people I found on internet said I am a overthinker, I think too much and should just enjoy life. They acted like this was just a little problem but the truth is, I can't see how I can fix this because I can't live with this feeling on my head all my life... it's just so disturbing. And telling this to doctor makes me feel so unconfortable because it seems to be something really small but the feeling is just annoying.\n\nI tried to go to doctor today but woke up too late... Slept 4 hours today, couldn't sleep early. I will try to go tomorrow...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright so any help would be appreciated guys, I'm feeling like this for so long and I don't know how much I can handle this. :(\n\nThanks.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T10:18:33+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T10:18:34+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebu28q/dealing_with_paranoic_conclusions_and_lack_of/"}

They\u2019ve moved, had families, etc. I\u2019m so happy that their lives are wonderful. Last year I was diagnosed with epilepsy and dissociative seizures and my life went from career-woman to someone housebound, unemployed (except for my hobby business) and I can\u2019t drive. Ive been stuck in my house since June 2017. There\u2019s no public transport nearby and I have no close friends or family to help. I\u2019ve become crippling lonely. I have a partner but he works four days at a time with virtually no contact. My son is great but he\u2019s also 4 so there\u2019s not much in the way of adult conversation.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted the play Magic the Gathering. My partner recently decided he wanted to as well. So I spent a full day learning the rules, how to do combat, what everything means and so forth. Then we went to a local store to but cards that also holds casual game nights and serious matches and we were invited to come down and play. So we started playing at home heaps, but my partner told me we had been playing wrong and the rules I learned were incorrect, so I had to relearn the whole game again with the way he said the rules are. I just took it as he is right, and I am wrong instead of questioning it. Because of my neurological problems I struggle with memory so I worked really really hard to get to a point where I could play. However today my partner told me I was correct in how I was playing originally and he was wrong and I\u2019d have to relearn the game again. So I just quit. It was at the point where I wasn\u2019t going to be able to unjumble the two. And start again for a third time. \n\nI was so excited and then it turns out I didn\u2019t have it and had to start all over again. It\u2019s not an easy thing to master for someone with my brain problems and I worked really hard. I became really good at it too after about 50 games.\n\n\nWhy did I work so hard? I so badly wanted to be a part of a group. I wanted to go make friends and do something I enjoy. I thought I would finally find a way to get some reprieve from the crippling loneliness I feel. Ever since I became sick I\u2019ve lost my ability to do most of the things I love, I was so excited to make friend close by that I could Uber too and afford it. I wanted to learn new things. I wanted to get in with all of the others games that are played too.\n\nNow my partner is down at the store playing with everyone and another friend because he can pick any game up after a few rounds and I\u2019m at home, lonely, trying so hard to make something hobby wise work for me and I can\u2019t. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just depressed because I thought I\u2019d have something to ease the feeling of uselessness I feel and I unintentionally got screwed.

In past years I used to have crazy anxiety over it, my mood swings were all over the place, one day I was confident, the next I was timid and was scared to talk to people because I was scared they wouldn't like me. Honestly I'm thankful for everything that's happened in my life, as much as I would like to say I'd like to redo everything, I wouldn't. I believe everything in life happens for a reason. Even though I felt lonely, lost and wasn't sure who I was anymore, it helped shape me as a person. People who barely knew me were judging me because of other kids were talking about me behind my back, calling me stupid and \"retarded\". It crushed my self confidence and honestly I hated myself, it wasn't until a year ago that I started loving myself, and over the past year, my confidence, my anxiety, honestly everything has changed. I wasn't hated by everyone at the school by any means, but my reputation was pretty much just me being a loser. As much as I want to say my past is behind me, it isn't and it's affecting my present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year was Grade 12 for me or year 12, and every year before that I kept telling myself throughout high school that I would start trying in grade 11, prior to that I did no work, and was just passing my classes. My depression got the best of me and I started skipping, a lot. At one point I skipped for 3 weeks straight, it got to the point where I was so unmotivated and sad I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. It was only when I got a call home saying that if I didn't go to school I was going to be kicked out. I ended up failing grade 12. I don't find school hard by any means, but my work ethic is awful and I'm scared for what the future has in store for me. This year I'm back doing another year of grade 12, and I just want to say that from the start of this school year to now, I haven't felt happier. I've been focusing on me, what I need in my life, cutting out the toxicity, I do feel lonely sometimes, but I know when I put myself back out there I'll find the group of kids I'm looking for, that's something I'm looking forward to in university/college. Anyways I feel like I'm all over the place here, my point is all my bad habits are getting the best of me, and I want to know how to just overcome lack of motivation and just do it. I know that question will vary from person to person as everyone is different, but I guess I'm desperate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a gf of 4 months, we've been great friends for around 8 months. She's quite possibly the most amazing girl/person I could have asked for. We shared a class together, before we became friends a friend of mine was cracking jokes to her that I was going to ask her to prom, quite honestly the best thing he's done for me even though he obviously had all the wrong intentions. Later that night she texted me and that was when we started talking. I already had a crush on her, not that anyone knew that. Honestly I admired her, she was funny, easy to talk to, funny, cute, extremely likable, smart, and kind. I love this girl with all my heart and she has no idea what kind of great impact she's had on my life. I've never been happier and I'm not going to say it's all thanks to her, but she's definitely got a part in it. Anyways we talked for a great while, and all people did was make fun of her, but slowly but surely her close friends were accepting of it, and here we are. One thing that's always bugged me about our relationship is how secretive of it she is. She doesn't want me commenting on her social media (She wouldn't be mad or anything if I did, but she'd prefer if I didn't) because she doesn't want kids from high school to see it, not that she's ashamed of me but she doesn't like being judged because of it. Honestly can I even blame her, the one thing I've been trying to do is better myself, my mental health is great, I'm not the kid I used to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've been trying to do is better myself like I said before. The saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger applies a lot to my life. Well all anything in my life has done, is make my skin thicker, I don't care anywhere near as much what other people think of me. I mean I do a little, but everyone cares to an extent, if you say otherwise you're lying. I've pretty much changed my entire wardrobe. The thing was I cared too little about what other people thought about me, I stopped caring about everything in general, and the fact that this girl saw through all my flaws and still dated me makes me love her that much more. Anyways one thing I want to do for myself is get really fit. I just want to look great, not for anyone's opinion to change, but almost as a big fuck you. Who the fuck are you to judge me, try judging me now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know everything I need to do, it's just a matter of doing it. I just feel so lost because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, I don't want to just pick a career and settle for it. I want to do something I enjoy, the problem is my interests change all the time. One moment I love something, the next second I don't care anymore. I've also been pissing away this year again, I'm currently doing a victory lap or pretty much grade 12 again, and honestly I've barely done anything and I'm mad at myself, I'm tired of blaming everything on my past. I'm tired of getting mad at my parents and telling them they wouldn't understand. Essentially I'm tired of feeling bad for myself. It's time for me to get my life together, I'm going to make everyone in my life proud. I'm going to start off by making a schedule, I'm going to follow that schedule, I'm also going to make days for my gf to come hang out with me, other than that I'm going to focus on school rn. It's time for me to follow a schedule for once in my life. I don't even know why I'm going to post this because I've pretty much made a plan for myself right here. I guess I just needed to rant and be clear everything up for myself because whether I like to admit it or not, sometimes I don't realize why I'm upset until late at night when I'm alone and have time to think clearly without any distractions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI focused too much on trying to please other people and not enough on myself. If I could go back in time I would try and set myself straight. Throughout my entire life my priorities have been totally wrong. I wish I could've told myself that what these kids thought of me doesn't matter. I'm thankful that I decided to write this, I feel much better and am thinking clearer, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

I've kind of always known (From suicide attempts, to being mocked a sadist cause I'm never happy, to substance abuse, and weekly cries and just plain hating being alive), but never thought it was mental illness till I read the description of this sub and connected with a lot of posts. I really have no one to talk to, and I know I need help. And I can't get the help without money (which I so so do not have). I'm a 25 y/o, unemployed, unmotivated slob, still living at home and abandoned by everyone, because I can't get my shit in order, which this sub let me realize is because I'm depressed. And online research let me know I have adult ADD. All things no one in my country ever talks about or even knows about. Trust me, the majority of people here will say I need prayers and deliverance instead. \n\nI really need to open up to someone that can help me out. I need therapy. Found better help through the app I'm using to stay sober, but it's not free. Any free options out there?\n\nI feel this sub can be considered as one, but I don't know where to start from. I've created really long posts about my life trying to get help, but they get posted, just never visible to the sub it's posted to. I'll only see it in my profile posts. Maybe because it's too long.

In past years I used to have crazy anxiety over it, my mood swings were all over the place, one day I was confident, the next I was timid and was scared to talk to people because I was scared they wouldn't like me. Honestly I'm thankful for everything that's happened in my life, as much as I would like to say I'd like to redo everything, I wouldn't. I believe everything in life happens for a reason. Even though I felt lonely, lost and wasn't sure who I was anymore, it helped shape me as a person. People who barely knew me were judging me because of other kids were talking about me behind my back, calling me stupid and \"retarded\". It crushed my self confidence and honestly I hated myself, it wasn't until a year ago that I started loving myself, and over the past year, my confidence, my anxiety, honestly everything has changed. I wasn't hated by everyone at the school by any means, but my reputation was pretty much just me being a loser. As much as I want to say my past is behind me, it isn't and it's affecting my present. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year was Grade 12 for me or year 12, and every year before that I kept telling myself throughout high school that I would start trying in grade 11, prior to that I did no work, and was just passing my classes. My depression got the best of me and I started skipping, a lot. At one point I skipped for 3 weeks straight, it got to the point where I was so unmotivated and sad I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. It was only when I got a call home saying that if I didn't go to school I was going to be kicked out. I ended up failing grade 12. I don't find school hard by any means, but my work ethic is awful and I'm scared for what the future has in store for me. This year I'm back doing another year of grade 12, and I just want to say that from the start of this school year to now, I haven't felt happier. I've been focusing on me, what I need in my life, cutting out the toxicity, I do feel lonely sometimes, but I know when I put myself back out there I'll find the group of kids I'm looking for, that's something I'm looking forward to in university/college. Anyways I feel like I'm all over the place here, my point is all my bad habits are getting the best of me, and I want to know how to just overcome lack of motivation and just do it. I know that question will vary from person to person as everyone is different, but I guess I'm desperate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a gf of 4 months, we've been great friends for around 8 months. She's quite possibly the most amazing girl/person I could have asked for. We shared a class together, before we became friends a friend of mine was cracking jokes to her that I was going to ask her to prom, quite honestly the best thing he's done for me even though he obviously had all the wrong intentions. Later that night she texted me and that was when we started talking. I already had a crush on her, not that anyone knew that. Honestly I admired her, she was funny, easy to talk to, funny, cute, extremely likable, smart, and kind. I love this girl with all my heart and she has no idea what kind of great impact she's had on my life. I've never been happier and I'm not going to say it's all thanks to her, but she's definitely got a part in it. Anyways we talked for a great while, and all people did was make fun of her, but slowly but surely her close friends were accepting of it, and here we are. One thing that's always bugged me about our relationship is how secretive of it she is. She doesn't want me commenting on her social media (She wouldn't be mad or anything if I did, but she'd prefer if I didn't) because she doesn't want kids from high school to see it, not that she's ashamed of me but she doesn't like being judged because of it. Honestly can I even blame her, the one thing I've been trying to do is better myself, my mental health is great, I'm not the kid I used to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've been trying to do is better myself like I said before. The saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger applies a lot to my life. Well all anything in my life has done, is make my skin thicker, I don't care anywhere near as much what other people think of me. I mean I do a little, but everyone cares to an extent, if you say otherwise you're lying. I've pretty much changed my entire wardrobe. The thing was I cared too little about what other people thought about me, I stopped caring about everything in general, and the fact that this girl saw through all my flaws and still dated me makes me love her that much more. Anyways one thing I want to do for myself is get really fit. I just want to look great, not for anyone's opinion to change, but almost as a big fuck you. Who the fuck are you to judge me, try judging me now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know everything I need to do, it's just a matter of doing it. I just feel so lost because I have no idea what I want to do for the rest of my life, I don't want to just pick a career and settle for it. I want to do something I enjoy, the problem is my interests change all the time. One moment I love something, the next second I don't care anymore. I've also been pissing away this year again, I'm currently doing a victory lap or pretty much grade 12 again, and honestly I've barely done anything and I'm mad at myself, I'm tired of blaming everything on my past. I'm tired of getting mad at my parents and telling them they wouldn't understand. Essentially I'm tired of feeling bad for myself. It's time for me to get my life together, I'm going to make everyone in my life proud. I'm going to start off by making a schedule, I'm going to follow that schedule, I'm also going to make days for my gf to come hang out with me, other than that I'm going to focus on school rn. It's time for me to follow a schedule for once in my life. I don't even know why I'm going to post this because I've pretty much made a plan for myself right here. I guess I just needed to rant and be clear everything up for myself because whether I like to admit it or not, sometimes I don't realize why I'm upset until late at night when I'm alone and have time to think clearly without any distractions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI focused too much on trying to please other people and not enough on myself. If I could go back in time I would try and set myself straight. Throughout my entire life my priorities have been totally wrong. I wish I could've told myself that what these kids thought of me doesn't matter. I'm thankful that I decided to write this, I feel much better and am thinking clearer, I'm not feeling sorry for myself. All I know is I'm not going to take shit from anyone anymore.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T08:23:34+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T08:23:35+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebt4pe/if_i_can_overcome_the_bullshit_in_my_life_so_can/"}

I have barely any friends and I'm also a virgin who hasn't so much as held hand or kissed a girl even. I don't get along with my family whatsoever and had an older brother who would emotionally abuse me my whole childhood and a shitty father and I don't have any interest in speaking with them. I don't have the energy or willpower to move to do anything productive. I've tried everything and I'm at my ends now.\n\nMy whole life it felt like I was just been going through the motions, on autopilot with fog clouding up my brain and there wasn't much that made me happy or glad to be alive. I dropped out of college after 2 weeks and just started sitting in my dorm for the rest of the semester playing videogames and eating pizza and cheeseburgers. After that, I went to live in a tiny apartment with my family and began working deadend jobs and continue being depressed. I soon realized that I needed to make some changes and began to try everything I could think of to break out of this spell.\n\nI began trying different SSRI's from the doctors in hopes that they would help with my depression but all they did was make me numb and get no joy from anything anymore even music which was pretty much the only thing that could make me happy. I still feel that taking those had some long term effects on me where it's harder to feel joy now but idk. After that I tried going to the gym and eating well, I did this for about a year and was still depressed and eventually stopped. \n\nAt this point, I knew living with my family in their tiny apartment wasn't helping. I moved into an apartment with a couple of friends and was able to start doing some things again. I began cooking a lot and started eating a lot of rice, chicken, and fish + fruits and greek yogurt mostly. I started to read about psychology and just how the mind works but with a specific interest in the habit loop. I planned to use this knowledge to break some of my negative habits and form positive ones in their place but I've had trouble applying it. I started to do yoga and read a lot more and I felt myself gradually getting better it felt like. This whole time the debt from my college experience and my car loan were too much for me to handle and I just started ignoring the debt collectors as I tend to go back in my shell and ignore problems when they're too much for me.\n\nWhile living with my friends, I took acid a few times and it changed my whole perspective on life. I started to spend a lot of time working on electronic music I bought a guitar and it felt like my life had purpose now and something to work towards. This invigoration lasted about a year and then eventually I just felt all my creativity and will to live disappear again at which point I started taking DXM occasionally. It feels like I need to be high on something or I can't be happy or creative.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I got formally diagnosed with ADD and began taking adderall to help with my concentration. Again, I felt completely reinvigorated and began to find joy in being productive. I completely stopped playing videogames and started spending that time learning web development, music production, astrophysics, philosophy, geometry and just anything that interested me. Eventually my motivation quit on me again. I started to feel a lack of progress, I tried to work through it with journaling but to no avail. That happened around March of this year and I haven't been able to do one productive thing since and I quit the adderall after 2 months of it not working. \n\nI became good online friends with a trans girl on the other side of the world about 9 months ago. For 3 or 4 months we would play video games together or just talk for 8-14 hours every single day. She would tell me all about her deepest secrets and we would vent to each other and I really enjoyed spending time with someone for once. I haven't been that intimate with someone since a girl I had feelings for in high school. Anyway we gradually stopped spending as much time together and I would make her feel guilty for it and kind of be mean to her for wanting to spend time with anyone else. She put up with it for awhile but after a few months she just kind of is over the bullshit and blocks me for a few days if I do anything a little toxic. I developed feelings for her but she doesn't feel the same way about me and it's really hard for me to just be her friend. I got into obsessively seeing what she was up to and kinda estalking her I guess and being mean to her when she spends time with anyone else. and I hate that I can't stop myself from doing that. I don't know how I'll ever be able to form a real relationship with someone when I know I'll just be obsessive and creepy and toxic if things don't go my way. I've done this to any girl I've gotten feelings for that talks to me back and I hate that I can't just be chill.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I really don't. I've tried therapy. I've tried all sorts of medication. I've tried exercising and eating healthy. I've tried developing hobbies that give me joy. I've tried to get close to people but anyone I get close to I'll just be toxic to. I eat like shit right now, I don't have the energy to cook or go to the grocery store and just order food every day. I don't clean. All I do is sit and play videogames with high school friends or the trans girl all day and wait for her to want to talk to me. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I can't fix my life and I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I just can't be consistent. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? I don't think I'll ever be happy at this point. I've tried as hard as I can to fix my problems but they won't go away. I probably have some underlying personality disorders from how I treat people or maybe some kind of form of OCD from some other things I do but I can't really afford therapy and when I've tried there's been 0 progress. The only thing I think that could make me happy is having a girlfriend that makes me want to be better for her but I can't imagine even getting one in my current state or anytime soon and everyone just would see me as pathetic with my lack of experience.

I didn't want to live, and being quite honest there is a part of me that still doesn't; that hardly changes.

I highly suggest any one who is confused about why the fuck we're here to look up one of his hundreds of videos on Youtube and try your best to really concentrate and think about what he's saying ( he's quite sophisticated and complex). I don't want to preach and be the type of guy that says this is a \"quick fix\" or \"life changing\", but for me his words hit deep and it was honestly reassuring listening to someone like him admit that life is hard and mostly suffering but it's how you respond which makes it meaningful.  I hope i can could help anyone who wants/needs it.\n\nBTW: To all the Jordan Peterson Fans, I knew of him way earlier (2015 or so) and got my life on track (so i'm not new to the rodeo nor trying to start a new \"fad\"), but after \"cleaning my room\" and \"standing tall with my shoulders back\" i got comfortable and slumped back into mediocrity ...

I\u2019ve hated myself more and more since my junior year but I only motivated myself because of one person. A dear friend of mine, she was my sole reason to try. I swear, the only reason I made it through the past year was because of her. I didn\u2019t think I would have been able to get out of bed every morning if not for her. I wouldn\u2019t have eaten, worked, or exercised if not for her. All she had to do was be in my presence, and I would feel happiness. I didn\u2019t cry myself to sleep because I would fantasize about life together, in the future. I guess I only cared about myself because I felt I had to be the best for her. She never knew any of this. \n\nI had always thought I was asexual or just had a really low sex drive. I had never been interested in girls, dating, etc. and I\u2019ve only had what I can describe as light crushes. Barely even that. This person made me feel feelings I didn\u2019t even know existed. When you would do anything for them, and you just can\u2019t stop thinking of them. We played video games together, watched movies. Hung out, developed inside jokes, made memories. I grew more and more attracted to her over my junior year. \n\nI confessed my feelings four months ago. You can guess how it went. I respect her wishes. But I felt horrible that she had to deal with me now. So I ghosted her. I want her to forget about me so that I\u2019m not even a bad memory anymore.

I despised myself and punished my body.\n\nMy parents didn\u2019t care. Of course they wouldn\u2019t. I hardly think they see me as anything more than test scores and trophies.

I think it started around 2014-16 in middle school I was bullied for my race (black) and at that time i never felt so alone. But i never told anyone because I thought it would get worst. In this school snitches were looked downed at. And if I did stand up for myself I would get ganged up on by multiple people. I felt stuck and had no way to get myself out. As the months went by being made fun of was a daily thing for me. The main thing that got me through that tough time was video games. I could play all day and night. Some days I wouldn't do my work because I was to stressed out to work and used video games as my escape (Rainbow 6 siege, Smite, Minecraft, and Halo). Playing my game isolated me but made me feel better. In 2017 we moved to a new house and my parents thought a private school would be better for me (8th Grade). Well that didn't work out either. I didn't get made fun of but I also didn't have any friends there. Just imagine one full year of having know one to talk to. And in order to compensate I stayed in my room played my video games. At the time I was failing some of my classes but I didn't care because I wasn't the best student at the time so I knew they wouldn't hold me back, they definitely did not want to deal with for another year. As that year went by I stayed in my room longer and longer, only coming out when I had to eat or use the bathroom. And even some days I didn't eat of wash up because it would interrupt me playing. I swear that I was super close with my family but over time I became much more closed off from my family. Now i'm in high school. You know more work, harder classes and lots of stress. All the stress built up so I relieved it by playing video games. My games use to take the pain away but now it seems to make it worst. All day I just stay in my room, some days I will just stare in a blank TV for hours on end. This part I really don't know how to explain in words, but i'll try anyway. It seems that my mind attacks me with all my past mistakes and they haunt all day and night if I don't distract myself. And when that distraction is over it feels like i'm getting pelted with hundreds of rocks. And the only place I feel safe is my room. My parents call my room a dungeon cause they don't see me outside it. But when I leave my room i fell out of my element. Like i'm not allowed to be myself. And when I try to be myself I get yelled at. Its like I have to wear a mask when I leave my room or i'll be petrified. BUT here is the best part my parents say i'm hard to talk to or its difficult to get along with me but when I try to limit their exposer I get yelled at. I try to be nice but it doesn't come naturally to me. My mom thinks I enjoy being mean.

After taking to a therapist and being prescribed kolonopin it helped and I went through a period of more mild anxiety. Recently I noticed I was beginning to have those same random thoughts again, and talking to my therapist about it, and was prescribed Xanax.\n\nWhere Zoloft comes in: \nI have been worried about benzodiazepine addition when I was first prescribed klonopin, so when I was prescribed Xanax I knew that it is more dangerous than K, so I have only been allowing myself it once or twice a week even though I\u2019m prescribed 1mg upto three times a day, (1mg doesn\u2019t do much to me not sure why because I never took the K daily or much more than 3 times a week). I started taking Xanax more as my anxiety\u2019s gotten bad and have been taking them more than I\u2019d like to allow my self and started to almost self medicate when I\u2019ve been having this anxiety more which now includes depression (I\u2019ve been considering myself a high functioning slightly depressive)\nSo worrying about building up a dependency to benzodiazepines I said that I think I would like to try a low level or lose dose antidepressant even though I hate the idea of it, didn\u2019t really want the stigma of anti depressants and side effects, but did because it would be something more long term and overall mood changing and It could possibly benefit me.\n\n(I do know Zoloft is supposed to take weeks was told 4 weeks for your fam to see, 8 for you)\n\nDay 1: Took it about noon, a bit later I started feeling kind of hazy and almost high, dis coordinated at times. I also paced a bit during the day, hung out with a friend felt pretty fine and and later felt a bit nauseous, barely noticeable though, at night I was very anxious and took a klonopin. \n\nDay 2: Took Zoloft at the same time. Called off work \nWas hazy again and pacing more and was not comfortable. Played video games and talked to family for most of the day, talked to them a bit more about what\u2019s going on. Took a kolonopin. Was getting depressed, had to go get gas for my car and on the drive there was listening to music and thought that if I was to get in a car accident and die this would be the time (sounds sad typing this and actually letting people hear) when I left the gas station I passed  my sub and just felt like going on a drive which was relaxing. I felt depressed still at home and was having anxious ruminating thoughts on the past and took another kolonopin and went to bed.\n\nDay 3: Woke up felt fine took the Zoloft around the same time as the day before felt a bit hazy again but fine was pretty content with everything, later went to work and felt like a zombie felt like my brain was cloudly and that I had little emotion, looked at things from the past and got sad but smoked a bit and went to bed.\n\nI seriously think I\u2019m having side effects because before I\u2019ve always been happy, driven, but a worryier and possibly a high functioning depressive but I\u2019ve never been like this. Am I experiencing side effects? Should I contact my doctor?", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T07:00:58+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T07:00:59+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebsf07/2nd_day_of_zoloft_terrible_anyone_have_experience/"}

The next two years it turned into some fairly bad anxiety and depression, I\u2019m now 15, in year 9, going onto year 10. I spent all of this year wandering the halls trying to find someone to talk to, nobody was there. I felt so isolated in this pitch black claustrophobic box they call depression. Come by November and this month, i met a girl, and she was so perfect. She was my first kiss and the closest i had ever been to anyone ever. She was the light of my life, for once i was finally feeling better about myself. Unfortunately, for reasons I\u2019m not going to say because shes everything to me, she decided it was better to be friends (for the time being). She told me that yesterday. It destroyed me, i planned to ask her out the weekend coming. It may only be for the time being but shes now leaving me on delivered for 2 hours at a time, which to me feels like a lifetime. I told her that I\u2019m going to wait for her until shes ready for a relationship, however long that may be. But i have a feeling that the longer i wait, the worse ill become, because I\u2019m now back to having nobody.

I had plans to do many things these holidays: Work to get some money to buy maybe something I want, go out with friends, play video games (obviously), lose weight and study, as my results recently have been sub-par, which I had decided to change over the New Years.\n\nBut nothing is fucking going to plan.\n\nI'm a Blackbelt in Taekwondo and during sparring a few weeks back, I blocked a kick with my hand in an extremely awkward position. It severely hurt my wrist but after 2 weeks it got better, with some mild annoyances still present; but mostly better. Jump to the present 7 weeks later, turns out an X-ray revealed that I had fractured the third metacarpal, meaning that I would be stuck in a splint on my dominant hand (right) for 6 weeks, the entire length of my holidays. \n\nIts now significantly harder to do anything, including writing this goddamn long rant about my fucking life. Gaming is a big part of my life which I often indulge in during the holidays: I can fucking say goodbye to that shit. \n\nI'm also naturally lazy, despite being a consistent 80%+ performer while studying for tests on the day, but my 57% math score really did a number on me, let alone my Asian parents. Before my splint, I started studying an easy 3 hours a day, as it gave me a sense of relief from my bad score as I felt like through hard work would make up for my past mistakes; a sense of redemption. My fucking injury has made it impossible to do maths equations (injured writing hand), meaning I will have to work doubly hard with online resources like Khan Academy instead.\n\nI've read many articles on injury caused depression recently, and the general consensus that I've come up with is the first step is too accept the limitations.\n\n\\- There will be no video games\n\n\\- studying will be harder\n\n\\- Life will be harder\n\nI do still have a speck of hope that when the physio gives me a more high-tech splint that allows my ring finger to move a pen and play league or my recovery will be faster than the allotted 6 weeks, but the truth has started to dawn on me that there is no easy way out from this injury.\n\nFriends are something I still have, as hanging out with them would still be a distinct possibility if my mum didn't go apeshit. My grandparents are coming over and I had planned a sleepover which was harshfully rejected as I should 'spend time with my grandparents.' They are here for a good 3 weeks and I'm sure they will also go out with friends during their time here, meaning that my request to spend time with my friends does not seem unreasonable. One thing she uses against me is my report, which I only got 6 A's and 3B's , and it doesn't help that 2 of the B's are maths and science.\n\nIn a way she is not wrong, but I've been feeling like shit recently, and she nor my injury is helping. I felt like dog shit before I was this restricted and now I'm feeling even worse. In the past I would not play long hours to feel good, but to relieve the emptiness, pain of life and real world worries. I don't blame my mum for getting triggered at me, as she doesn't fucking understand anyway. Even I think my life is pretty stress free from her perspective.\n\nI've spent my last weekend doing nothing; being lazy and watching YouTube while craving for a game of League of Legends with some friends. I have become the person I vowed to destroy; stupid, lazy and fat.\n\nIf anyone has any tips it would be appreciated; Thank you.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T06:42:06+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T06:42:07+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebs8o0/am_i_making_a_fuss_or_am_i_just_really_depressed/"}

I can't take it amymore", "author": "iFunnyPrince", "selftext": "This is mostly a copy/paste from a r/legaladvice thread I posted so sorry if it reads weird.\n\nMy mother is a recovering alcoholic and also has severe anxiety towards the health of her parents. We were living with our grandparents trying to get back on out feet (they welcomed us with open arms) and everything was great, we were able to help my grandparents with activities of daily living in exchange for a place to stay... Until my uncle calls and screams at my grandmother until she cries and says he and my mother's sister are going to visit us and stay in the home.\n\nAnyways, my mother's siblings have a history of doing horrible things so she was understandably stressed, being forced to deal with her nightmare siblings right after her dad had a stroke. She stayed home (didn't live once) for over a month just to take care of them.\n\nOne night, my uncle attempted to physically block her from helping my grandfather to use the bathroom and she had had a few drinks. Grandpa has always needed help in the past and always will. After she tried to push past him he tackled her to the ground and her head hit the floor, hard. My mom was not being violent at all. They proceeded to call the police and said my mother was causing a disturbance. When the police got there they asked me what happened, I told them he threw her onto the hard wood floor. I didn't see much else.\n\nThis ended in my mom being taken to the hospital and my uncle tried to kick me out of the house (which he doesn't own) the next day I went to visit my mom because I didn't trust them. When I returned they locked me out and called the police, forcing us to leave. They then proceeded to try to repossess presents my grandparents gave me over the years unsuccessfully, but they got my car because it was still in my grandmother's name to my knowledge. They accused me of being a drug dealer after finding my grandmother (and my) stash of cannabis, and a jar of a powdered supplement they assumed was cocaine (it wasn't)\n\nMy mom is not allowed to see her parents until both her siblings \"judge her as being clean and sober for an extended period of time\". She asked to see her parents before New year's and they acted like they didn't know who she was.\n\nI called my uncle and told him he needed to let my mother see her parents before they pass on. He told me that they have a restraining order against my mom and she cannot go near them. The police have done much more harm than help unfortunately. He threatened to call the police if I contact him again. We have contacted all local law enforcement agencies we could think of and still cannot find out if there is a restraining order, although I suspect they're bluffing.\n\nI have nothing now. I have my mom. I have an apartment a crackhead wouldn't want to live in. I can't go a single day without using pretty much every drug in existence. Life is a living hell. I was going to go to college. I was going to be something.\n\nNow I'll be dead. I can't afford medicine, I can't even afford to miss a day of work due to terrible management and lack of healthcare. I'm 20 and not only do I not have a car but I keep failing my driver's test so that ruins any chance of forming any kind of relationship with anybody, romantic or not. My family framed me. My uncle beat my mom half to death. All of my friends either abandoned me or want to hang out so they can steal something from me.\n\nThe day I die will be the happiest day of my life.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T05:42:11+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T05:42:12+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebrnce/my_family_destroyed_our_lives_and_left_us/"}

I\u2019m married I have 2 kids. I got with my husband back in 2002 when we were kids and we had many breaks in between, involuntary and voluntary, but started dating again in 2007 first baby in 09 and married in 15 and second baby in 16. When we were dating I found out about his cheating. I had the cell phone and I allowed him to use it and I heard voicemails from other girls about them meeting up and whatever. So I knew it was going on. Found condom in my backseat he said it was because of his friend. I am no dummy but I was so head over heels so I took the lie and went with it. Fast forward some and he went to jail and I cheated. I was 21 and I was hurt by his cheating and I also wasn\u2019t ready to settle I guess. I was confused. Then I got pregnant in 09 with our first born. We fought. My oldest daughter is a true miracle. She was so tough to survive and she made me survive for her! But I was stupid and never left. I knew so much of his continued cheating but never left. I was happy until i thought of his cheating. But over all the years I knew I never cheated back. Saw the girls pictures in the phones saw the messages and still stayed. I\u2019m stupid. 2016 I was pregnant and he was always fussing at me and putting me down. Told me so much mean things I would cry constantly. Did he care ? No. Was I stupid for staying? HELL YES!  He wouldn\u2019t come home at night and one night he didn\u2019t come home until after 3 pm the next day. Wouldn\u2019t answer or text back. Came home with what looked like cum on his shirt. He denied it I knew it. Stupidity won again. Fast forward to 2019 I found him cheating. He had girls in the new house we bought a few months before and I saw the evidence of that 2 times. He was at a hotel with a girl. Tracked him there from the uconnect out 2018 cars had. He wouldn\u2019t open the door. He protected this other girl. He fussed at me and made me leave after showing my ass. He wouldn\u2019t open that door! Ugh! That was in March 2019 and I kept having that pain inside me from that. I  did something I NEVER do and i confided in someone else at my work. Then it turned to a different form of friendship. We started sleeping together. He was married and I was married and we shouldn\u2019t have done what we did. We talked daily and then my husband found out. He went to my work to confront him and it turned violently ugly. We said we wanted to work it out and then we didn\u2019t then we did and so on so on but I\u2019m severely depressed because 1) I have depression 2)I\u2019m bipolar (he always thought it was a joke and discouraged me from taking care of myself ) and he constantly torments me about what I did. I\u2019m all the names in the book. I\u2019m a awful mom and woman and nothing about me is good anymore. He does not even acknowledge that he has been cheating on me for years! And that he protected someone else over me. Everyday he has something negative to say. He hates my body now ( I have a nice body but a slight baby pouch ) he hates everything about me. When he found out about my cheating he held me down and cut my hair off . He did that twice. I had to go cut all my hair off to make it right again. I didn\u2019t press charges because he begged me not to. I never have and i should have 100s of times. The sheriff has asked me to. They have pictures of bruises all over me and broken fingernails. Then have the Snapchat of him cutting my hair. He posted all my hair. I wanted extensions in my hair because I miss my hair being lovely and long and I did it and he talked so much crap to me about it until I took it out. I told him how much it would make me happy and he took it all away from me. Made me feel so worthless and empty. He made me throw away my clothes and underwear. He made me do so much but he has done nothing. He lets me know DAILY I am nothing and he tried turning my girls against me by telling them so much they don\u2019t need to know. He is a awful person. I want to get away. I keep myself alive because I love my children so much. They are keeping my feet planted on this earth. They are innocent and beautiful souls. They are my EVERYTHING!!!! I don\u2019t know what to do. We share this house and he won\u2019t leave. He makes it all my fault. I wish I could post screenshots of his texts but I won\u2019t. But if I don\u2019t answer my phone he threatens me with other women but if he didn\u2019t answer it\u2019s just oh well. I don\u2019t talk to him like he talks to me. He talks crap about EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN talk crap about and he constantly throws my cheating in my face but can\u2019t take me talking about him. I need advice on how to hell to handle this.

Not only that but my gf that I really liked broke up with me after a year of dating (although I feel that that relationship was somewhat of an emotional abuse towards me by the last 4 months with the way she treated me) with the stress of the workload and the sadness of my girlfriend leaving me somewhat broke me in early 2019. Although I tried to get back up I couldn\u2019t. My grades before were average and I attended clubs such as MUN, a cancer awareness club, and a club that worked together with an Animal shelter. I also used to go to the gym and made good progress to become a better me. After all that happened in early 2019 my grades plummeted and I closed off my social life and i stopped attending clubs or working out. I started drinking at one point weekly for about 5 weeks. It got to a point where I was able to down half a liter of vodka with energy drinks in about 15-20 minutes. I started smoking heavily because I didn\u2019t know how to even start back up again. My May exams rolled through and I didn\u2019t do as well as I wanted to. This broke me further, not only that but the knowledge that I disappointed my parents to no end. This broke me. I gained weight and throughout the summer drinking alone became a regular occurrence. The thought of suicide also started to plague my mind. It would linger for weeks and then disappear for a few days and the cycle would repeat. After Highschool I didn\u2019t really have anyone to turn to. I stopped going out (but this started in February-March 2019) and stopped socializing. I would chose to stay in my room and just contemplate suicide. The drinking didn\u2019t help although I felt that drinking was the only way to speed up the day to day life I was living, I\u2019m not sure where I thought it would go or end but I wasn\u2019t really concerned with it. It was more of a though of trying to get to tomorrow so I could drink alone again. I tried to quit smoking in September, which worked until December where these thoughts eventually made me start smoking just for that rush of a small high I got. I did LSD 5 or 6 times during my summer (but the last time I did it made me realize just how much I wanted to jump through the 4th story window) and I smoked weed on a regular basis (every 2-3 days) I thought it would get better over time but I\u2019ve just seen myself descending into loneliness. I started thinking of ways to actually go through suicide and the effects it would have on the few people that are still around me. (I was never really close to my family and I was always a \u201ctrouble maker\u201d as a teenager). I\u2019ve never gone to a doctor and I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m scared to go through it alone. Where I come from having depression leads to you being looked down upon as weak or you get told to just stop being sad. I can\u2019t turn to my family because I don\u2019t want to disappoint them with the thought that their son is actually a useless and worthless person. And I\u2019m turning to the last place I can think for help, Reddit. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to even continue going through this. I respect everyone that is going through it and seeking help but there are times where I just don\u2019t want to seem vulnerable and reach out for help with the few people that are around me because I\u2019m scared it\u2019ll drive them away. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post and if you made it this far I thank you.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T04:28:39+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T04:28:40+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebqvc0/am_i_depressed_im_not_sure_where_to_post_this_im/"}

And I want to know if others feel the same way. \n\nSo here\u2019s my story.\n\nFor a long time, I never realized that my family was....a bit different from the rest. And as a young kid, how could I have known? But as I started getting older I noticed that most kids had this bond with their parents that I never had. It was like...they could tell them anything and everything. For me that was such a strange concept. My parents were like my \u2018authorities\u2019. I respected them and did what I was told. There were no \u2018feelings\u2019 involved. \n\nAs I continued to grow up, I noticed that other families did things that mine didn\u2019t. For instance, my best friend\u2019s family ate dinner together and talked. That was so bizarre to me. Normally when dinner time rolled around, my brother and I preheated frozen food from the freezer and ate in front of the tv while my parents screamed at each other in the kitchen.\n\nOh and another thing. \nThe screaming.\n\nMy parents screamed at each other every waking moment of the day. Sometimes, if they were really stressed, they also screamed at us. But I was happy because as long as they didn\u2019t hit us, we were fine.  I was scared that their anger would escalate to where they would hit us. And that usually never occurred.\n\nBut the hitting did.\n\nMy mom and dad hit each other. When that happened , my brother and I always looked away because it was too painful to watch the tears and angry words.\n\nSo what about now? Well my mom is never home because of work and my dad has very severe anger issues so we leave him alone.\n\nI guess the reason I\u2019m writing this is because my situation isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fault. My mom had abusive parents and my dad was kicked out of the house when he was young. \n\nSo why did this have to happen? Why does it feel like the best people in the world have to suffer the most? \n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nAnd that sucks.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T04:16:58+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T04:16:59+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebqqfu/i_hate_the_fact_that_im_writing_this/"}

When I was stationed in Korea we had a Curfew and needed to be back in our place of residence from 1-5 a.m. after 11 months and only being a month away from leaving and being stationed back at Fort Bragg my unit decided it was time for me to go to a promotion board. I stayed in for four weeks straight and studied as I saw myself staying in the Army for some time. The promotion board finally came and I nailed it and I have never been happier. This was a Wednesday so on Friday my closest friends and fellow soldiers decided to surprise me and take me out for a few drinks since I have denied them my company for the last month. We ended up staying out past curfew...not on purpose we just lost track of time. I noticed and proceeded to tell my friends that we were in the wrong part of Korea and needed to get out of the city for the night or we would get caught. They asked me to sit down as it was to late to anyways. I advised my friends that we should leave right then and there and they trusted me. We didn\u2019t get two feet out the door before being stopped by Korean Police escorted by an Army captain looking for soldiers out after curfew. We all got in trouble of course. After just passing the promotion board 48 hours prior to be eligible to be a sergeant I was  demoted to an E1 with 45 days extra duty. Due to my time in service I needed to be an E4 by the time I hit 6 years and with my time in service I would only need 6 months to reach E4 once again. I realized that I would hit 6 years five months into my punishment which would relieve me of service and end up being sent home. I fought for my right and ended up getting a meeting with a 2 star General to plead my case and ask to not be relieved of service. (NOTE: I had never been in trouble prior to this incident). I was a decent soldier and worked hard to get where I was. The general denied my appeal and said I was not fit for duty and sent me home. My entire career in the military means nothing and I feel nothing but sadness when I look back at a time that should have been my best years in life. I\u2019m literally in my bed right now about to go to bed and decided to pick up my phone and scroll through Facebook and ended up seeing the article stating that they removed the curfew permanently. This has sent me into an anxiety attack and I feel the sadness creeping in. Knowing that I lost everything for something that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore is mind blowing. I know this post is long but I just needed an outlet because I can fee my heart beating and it feels like it\u2019s going to blow out my chest. This incident has definitely caused me to have PTSD as I can\u2019t watch military movies anymore and I no longer hang any military plaques or medals in my home. Everything about the military saddens me as it makes me fee that I failed myself, my family, my fellow soldiers where 1 other was also relieved from service and my pride. The military was everything to me and because I was out late I was kicked out. I was 30 years old and celebrating. It was a simple mistake and I lost everything I ever worked for due to a curfew that no longer exist. I literally feel sick to my stomach. It has been two years since I was relieved of service and I still have nightmares, panic attacks and have been suicidal.

But the thing is the only thing that I have been diagnosed with fully is ADHD. The reason for that it because whenever I talk to someone I just try to hide the fact that I am also they dint have to pity me or worry about me and I even to it with counselors so they cant really diagnose me with it. So basically the reason I believe to why I became how I am is because when I was younger like younger than 6 young my dad used to beat me my mom and my brother and all of that caused me to start pulling my hair out in 1st grade this caused me to have no real friends my entire life even now and my dad whenever I would cut my hair he would punish me by beating me and doing haircut punishments this caused to to get severely bullied my entire life. But I had coping methods I started coping my doing good work and being the top student in the district at that time. That was until middle school when everyone started doing drugs and I would have to do peoples homework or else they would beat me up. This caused my grades to go down and my dad would start beating me more severely. And the thing with depression and ADHD is that I dont know how but when I am around people I just dot act overly hyper but when I am alone i start moving around like crazy some of the time the moving can last for up to around 8 to 9 minutes. But as of now I'm 16 still kinda pull my hair but since I've stopped my anxiety has gone through the roof and I now have no friends and the people I try to hang out with make fun of me daily and am now an f student I heard one of my teachers call me a failure when he thought I wasn't there.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T04:07:55+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T04:07:56+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebqmn9/why_did_i_have_to_be_born/"}

I dont know where to start.\nI just wanted to share whats been going on my mind. For years now. Maybe someone here might relate and understand me. English is not my fort\u00e9, so please bear with me.\n\nI havent tried going to any any Mental Health Doctors since its too expensive and from where I was brought up to, mental health is something to laugh about. Something that they just heard, known, but not really, put in their mind into.\n\nSince I was a kid, as early as I can remember, Ive been dreaming of dying. Im not really in good terms with my family at that time. Im the youngest one, next to me is my brother, who's one my enemy, and there's my eldest sister, who became my second mom.\nI know its normal for siblings to fight, but on what I have experienced, I think its the biggest factor why I never wanted to live. I believe I was only 6 or 7 maybe younger, and I always thought to myself that no one ever love me other than my sister.\n\nAs I grew older, the fights never went away. Adding the physical and verbal abuse from my parents. We go to church every Sunday. That is also why I loathe my parents before, since how can they 'praise God', lift up their hands and cry before the Lord, when after we go home. They will start saying foul words and hurt their kids so bad. My mom even said to my face that she regret bringing me to this world, that she shouldve killed me when I was still a baby. My dad, tried took advantages of me, attempted to sexually abuse me. My brother, always hated me. When I was in 6th grade, before the graduation, he punched me several times on the face, so when I went to school the next day. Half of my face was full of bruise. No one ever helped me. There was even one pastor, who gained my trust, I thought he will really help me out, but in the end, he aswell tried to take advantage of my young mind, trying to do sex over the phone, but he never succeeded on touching me.\n\nFrom then, I started hurting my self. Bit by bit, praying every night for God to take me. (My thoughts are jumbled, I cant tell my stories in order, sorry). \nI know its a sin to take one's life. Thats why I just pray for him give me some illness that will just kill me. Whenever I ride the bus or anything, there's always the hope for me to be in an accident. It would be freedom. Until now, I really dont know why would God let someone like me to live. Why He would protect me from every danger. There were lots and lots of accident around me, lots of people die every day, but why cant it be me? Why do I need to keep on living, there are other people that is more worthy to live. So why save me? I just wanted to disappear. I just wanted to die. Why cant he let me die.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T04:06:34+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T04:06:36+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebqm2r/a_life_without_meaning/"}

When he told me about it, he had already tried a couple meds that didn\u2019t seem to do anything but was finally on one that was seemingly working and he said he was feeling more like himself. I was absolutely floored because I had no idea of what he had gone through and because he seemed so together and happy throughout it all. \n\nIt\u2019s been about two years and he\u2019s doing a lot better from where he used to be, although I admittedly had no idea he was depressed. But earlier this week, he told me he is beginning to taper off the dosage of his medication. I suspect it is partly due to finances and partly due to him wanting to feel more in control of his mental health. He asked me to call him out if he starts withdrawing or behaving differently since I know him well and won\u2019t be afraid to do so, but I honestly am worried about this whole thing. \n\nI know everyone is different, that every friendship looks different, and there won\u2019t be a formula or \u201cright\u201d way to handle everything, but do you guys have any advice for me?

On some days it would be brilliant but on most other days it was hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was long before she ever said she had depression, so to someone who doesn't know you have depression, it felt like I was losing her. Her affection levels dropped dramatically too. So i felt as though I was losing her. I do have anxiety but I usually control it very well but ofcourse, when someone changes drastically, my anxiety flared up a lot. I began to have panic attacks for the first time in 5 years and I went to some pretty bad places. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter around 2 weeks of feeling more anxious than i ever have, she finally told me she was in a depressive episode and it all clicked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent a good week bringing myself back to baseline, I stopped blaming myself for her doing all this stuff, I went to therapy and went back to being happy again \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was also releasing my first book during this time so yah, I was under a fuckload of stress which has now subsided.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hung out twice since I became better and things seemed Great, I could see her pain and sadness but I was making her smile and laugh, and I was there to give her whatever affection she needed. I felt I could be a rock for her once again and apologised refusely for not seeing the signs prior. And for taking her actions so personally, it's hard to not respond that way when people don't tell you but now I know, I'll never forget it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI assumed stuff would be fine from this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApproximately 4 days ago, she came to me after a full day of hanging out and laughing / smiling, and said she believes she doesn't love me as much as I love her, this then turned into her saying \" I don't love you anymore\" which then turned into \"I don't love anyone at the moment\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis seems very odd considering 3 weeks ago we planned and payed for a worldwide holiday together and wanted to move in with one another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked if she wanted to break up with me and she said she didn't know. I then asked if she still wanted to go on the holiday we booked a few weeks ago and she said she thinks so. I also asked if this feeling of her not loving me anymore all started when she became depressed and she agreed it did. I asked if she meant what she said a mere few weeks ago in regards to moving in together and she said she did mean it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI agreed to give her time to think, as much time as she needs, I sent her a letter after the discussion, detailing why we got together and why we're together and that I would be infinitely patient with her, I apologised for my anxiety and assured her it has passed and that none of this was her fault and to let herself feel what she needs to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said she would get back to me within a week. In my personal experience, if you really wanted to break up with someone, you do it. We were in the discussion, I even asked her and gave her a clear out and she didn't take it. But I am understandably nervous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is that, should I be worried?

Hope everyone's staying warm and fighting the good fight this December. \n\nFor context- I started taking antidepressants (Prozac 20mg) this past summer, and for the last 5 months things had been looking somewhat better. Progress, at the least!\n\nHowever, this past weekend I realized I've been in the throes of a pretty rough depressive episode, my first such episode ever since starting the medication. I'm not surprised per se, because life comes in ups and downs and it's my emotional reaction to finals and a stressful semester coming to a close (I'm a third-year undergrad student). \n\nBut I've realized something- I'm hardly any closer to overcoming my soul-crushing loneliness than I was 5 months ago. For me, loneliness is the major focus of my depression. My most prevalent and hostile automatic thoughts revolve around the question: \"Am I going to feel this lonely for the rest of my life?\" Because I feel pretty suckishly lonely, and have been for the past 4 years. I don't have a ton of social anxiety per se... it's more that I float between states of either not feeling like I need to interact with people at all, or being horribly lonely and sad. I have friendly acquaintances/classmates and maybe a few people I hang out with once every two weeks or so, but no best friends or friend groups. Most of the time I do my own thing, and it's fine until all of the sudden the loneliness hits and being alone is suddenly an excruciating experience.\n\nBeing in college has helped a little by being able to surround myself constantly with people, enough to keep the loneliness somewhat at bay. But starting this semester I've been living off campus, and having a single in a 4bd apartment has been a double-edged sword. For all the luxuries of having my own space, lately I've felt more and more trapped and isolated.\n\nPeople have recommended taking up a hobby or other creative outlets, but I'm currently a theatre major in college and so my career essentially IS my creative outlet. And while I've tried to solve the loneliness by throwing myself into working on my career, it's left me burnt out, socially isolated, and more depressed than I've been in months. When I keep busy, things feel fine, but it's during the slow moments when I start feeling lonely, trapped, and on the verge of despair.\n\nAt the end of this long ramble, I guess I'm trying to ask for help and support. It's something I've been working on this past year (reaching out for help when I need it, instead of trying to suck it up and push past the pain). So if any of you wonderful human beings have tips or advice for how I can make more of a concerted effort to include friends in my life, I'm all ears. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T03:21:34+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T03:21:34+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebq2v1/first_loneliness_depressive_episode_after_5/"}

But suppose it's a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils--having an anxious childhood and dying while you still have the innocent hope of a bright future or growing up to realize that being normal and well adjusted was never a part of your story to begin with. \n\nAnd even though I was always the most 'mature' and reserved kid back then, I still had the freedom to 'be a kid' if I wanted to--to be innocent, oblivious, childlike, carefree. I often get super vivid flashbacks of doing mundane shit like playing an old video game or going to an easter egg hunt or having my mom read to me or playing on the playground. It literally feels like I'm there still, like I'm just daydreaming recess sitting in first grade. And then right when I'm immersed into it and forget out my life now, I'll get something just like the Alfred Hitchcock vertigo effect in my visual field and the sinking in your heart when you go over a rollercoaster as I'm hit with the realization that I was only 6 years old when those memories happened and I'm 22 now. \n\nIt just feels 'different' looking back. Very much in a dissociative/DPDR type way which makes me wonder if my stress as a child causing me to dissociate all the time before I even knew it was. I remember one morning I was sitting in the hallway in 2nd grade waiting to take a reading test or something but all I could focus on was the slightly distorted morning news broadcast from a radio down the hall. I just remember then it felt so un-fucking-real and I just thought how it felt like I was dreaming.  \n\nWell anyways, ironically, I haven't really been depressed or suicidal lately.

I keep trying to pull myself up by the bootstraps and muster through it all, do things that make me feel good, but I don\u2019t understand why I feel so awful. I hate certain things about my appearance. I have some qualities of my personality that I really love, and feel proud of, but my anxiety goes against all of my instincts and I say weird things and act weird because I am ultimately looking outward for validation. I have no security in myself. I feel terrified. This is so embarrassing, I just have no clue where to turn. \n\nI hate putting this out there and hate to feel like the victim, I just don\u2019t understand why I feel so terrible out of the blue. There are usually causes or \u201ctriggers\u201d... but they are quite small and my reaction to them and ability to cope with criticism or whatever it may be is completely unhealthy and unstable. I am so sad that my life is overtaken with this feeling.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T03:02:17+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T03:02:21+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebpu95/i_need_support/"}

I don\u2019t have any experience with this I\u2019ve always been the suffer in silence type I don\u2019t share when I\u2019m sad I always hide it until it goes away as I believe I can get over my problems much easier when it\u2019s just me solving it.\n\nI was always a pretty friendly person, just getting through life and having some close friends, nothing really too drastic, until one summer I decided I wanted to be more outgoing and energetic like I was with my family, just all the time. So I changed, and doing so made me so much happier. From then on I was always the most outgoing and crazy person around, I was happy with everyone and everyone loved hanging out with me and I loved it, I felt like I was my true self, it\u2019s what made me happy. I had this neighborhood group of friends which I loved more than anything else in the world. We all lived basically right next to eachother and I spent almost every second of my free time outside hanging out with them, growing up with them, getting into trouble with them, finding ourselves together. I was always the one outside with whoever could be with me, I was always that kid who loved being with people and hanging out. They really made me who I am today.\n\nAfter 6 years of this my family got up and moved us from the United States to Germany. I was a fucking idiot when they brought up the move for the very first time because I got excited and was all for it. I had no idea what the fuck I was really getting myself into, I was only like 13. I didn\u2019t realize the consequences. So yea, we moved. To the middle of nowhere in a village with farm lands and fertilizer tractors riding around stinking up the whole place every Thursday. When someone talks about being in buttfuck nowhere they have never been to this fucking village. There was nobody there, except an old ass senior home with old people everywhere. Nonetheless my dumbass was still optimistic that I was gonna \u201cmake new friends here\u201d and it would be exactly like my neighborhood back in the US just with... german kids.. But no, there were no german kids. There weren\u2019t any kids for that matter, I was all alone. \n\nThere was an international school about 1h30m train ride away from my house where I\u2019d be with people like me and everything would be in English. There was also a German school 15 minutes away which I could go to. So here comes mistake of a lifetime #2, I chose the German school. Worst fucking year of my entire life. Don\u2019t get me wrong I was still outgoing as shit I got along with everybody. But no matter how well you can get along with people throwing shit around acting like hooligans and kicking soccer balls at each others asses, there is no fucking connection, with anyone, when you can\u2019t sit down and have a real ass conversation with them. So here\u2019s where my depression truly started. I was lonely. Life felt like literal hell, I had no connection with anyone I was utterly miserable. The kids thought they were my friends but they had no idea how I was truly feeling under all of the stupid games we would play, and hey, I couldn\u2019t tell them, I was just the crazy american who laughed with them and was surprisingly good at soccer. Like I said, I couldn\u2019t speak their language, they spoke broken English but much too broken for me to open up about my feelings to them. It just wouldn\u2019t make sense. So I struggled through that year every way possible counting down the days and missing about half of the second semester of school due to me being \u201csick\u201d which was basically just me laying in my bed so depressed I couldn\u2019t get up. See I wasn\u2019t actually a student at that school. I was what they called a \u201cGastsch\u00fcler\u201d. Which is basically a guest that joins along in the classes to learn German from everyone and see if they would wanna continue their high school years at the school. Eventually that horrible year ended, and I decided to finally go to the international school despite having to take an 1h30m train ride every morning.\n\nI kinda fit right in at the international school, I made a group of friends who seemed cool, we had all the same interests... relatively. Shitty thing was this school was literally made for geniuses and I was a fucking dumbass so I failed basically everything and felt stupid all the time. Anyways, my \u201cfriends\u201d which I finally got after so long, decided to start making group chats without me and hanging out without me even though I was apart of their group so yea they were fucking dickheads and it took me the whole first year at that school to figure out what they were doing. Second year my family actually moved to the same city as my school which was really awesome because I was a 6 minute bike ride away instead of an 1h30 train ride. Problem was, I had no friends again. But I couldn\u2019t just have no friends. So I kept hanging out with those dickheads and I pretended to not notice that they would hangout without me and try and hide their stupid fucking group chats from me even tho it was obvious as fuck. Then everything changed.\n\nI met a girl. She was really amazing and we got along super well. I was always a boys kinda guy I never really had friends which were girls but this girl was different. She was so cool and I just clicked with her more than I had with anyone else before. Let\u2019s just call her Lucy. So Lucy and I eventually started dating and I didn\u2019t have to hangout with those dickheads anymore because I had my new bestfriend Lucy. About 2 months into the relationship she decided she wasn\u2019t happy and wanted to go on a break. I really didn\u2019t want to lose her so I tried to start fixing myself to cater to how she felt so that she would like me again. Which when I look back on it fucked me up a lot mentally. While we were on this break we agreed to not do anything with anyone else and that we would stay loyal. Then she cheated on me and after I found out she told me that she just had a \u201cvibe\u201d with this person and that she wanted to see where things would lead with him. I was heartbroken. But obviously not heartbroken enough because 2 weeks later she decided to not pursue her vibe with this one dude and I got back together with her. Like I said, I didn\u2019t have anyone else. We proceeded to date for another year and 5 months. About 5 months in she started acting all batshit crazy and I swear to god she was a fucking psychopath. She always wanted to fight she always was mad at me no matter what I did, I\u2019d spend hours trying to calm her down and make her happy again just for her to flip her shit again within five minutes. But she \u201cloved me so much\u201d. And it felt so good to have someone love me. So I told her I loved her back. I feel really bad about this. Honestly, I don\u2019t really know how I felt. I wanted to love her so bad, I just didn\u2019t really feel it. I hated myself for not feeling it but it just wouldn\u2019t come. But I couldn\u2019t leave her. First of all I had no one else, and I was such a fucking pussy I was so goddamn scared to do it I let this shitty ass miserable relationship go on for so long and it was such a mistake. See being with her made me feel trapped because I wanted to get away from the situation but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThis gave me crippling anxiety. It started out as a fear of throwing up in front of everyone and whenever I was \u201ctrapped\u201d in a room I would feel like I was going to throw up. Eventually it got worse and turned from the fear of throwing up when I was trapped, to a fear of having a heart attack. Which doesn\u2019t go well with anxiety because anxiety attacks feel like heart attacks and I had anxiety about having a heart attack, so yea. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere where I would feel trapped. I would lose my shit in the movie theatre, I couldn\u2019t concentrate a single second in school, I felt trapped everywhere I went. The one place I always felt safe before... my room. It didn\u2019t even feel safe anymore, nothing could protect me from a heart attack. So for weeks straight I swear my heart would not stop pounding, the only time it wasn\u2019t was when I was asleep because I couldn\u2019t think about having a heart attack but the second I woke up it was the first think on my mind and my heart would begin pounding again. It would get hard to breathe, it would become hard to eat and to drink, but I never told anyone. I don\u2019t know why, it was hard to think straight. So finally I simply could not take it anymore and I broke up with Lucy after we graduated. I broke her heart, and I didn\u2019t feel a thing. I finally ripped off the bandaid and I couldn\u2019t even cry. I wasn\u2019t able to. I lost the ability to cry at some point throughout my whole journey in Germany. I still can\u2019t. Every once in a while I\u2019ll explode for a few hours but that\u2019s like once every six months. I wish I could always cry, it feels so good, but I can\u2019t. Anyways she hates me now but we moved on and that was the end of that whole thing. I still hate all those dickheads I hung out with before Lucy. I want to move on but they are just such shit people I never met such shit people. I try though.\n\nAnyways, remember my friends from the US. Yea I sort of kept in contact with them after I moved but honestly, I wish I hadn\u2019t. The hardest thing in the world is seeing them on social media still growing up together while I\u2019m here alone miserable as fuck when this is not the life I was supposed to fucking live. I don\u2019t even know who they are anymore and they don\u2019t fucking care to ever talk to me. They would never ask me how I am or anything they just fucking moved on. No one would talk to me unless I would reach out to them. They assume just like everyone else I\u2019ve ever talked to that I am fine because I always act super happy and outgoing around people but once I am alone I couldn\u2019t be sadder, because I have no real friends to talk to. I know they still love me, cause they tell me. But I know they eventually stopped caring about me after I was gone. It hurts so bad. I hate seeing them together without me. I was always there. Now it\u2019s too late they\u2019re all going off to college and done being kids. I just wish we could be kids forever.\n\nSo here I am today. I have absolutely no one in my life except for my family who I love so very much but they are just so fucking annoying. I hate myself so much that I can\u2019t stand them because they try to help me but it pisses me the fuck off. I don\u2019t want their help they can\u2019t do anything for me they just want to \u201ctalk\u201d and cry with me. I need a peer. My best friend of all time, my brother who is 9 years younger than me, was my rock throughout everything, but I mean, how happy can I be hanging out with an 8 year old all day. It hurts so bad to turn him down because he looks up to me so much but I don\u2019t want to play legos all day, I want to be alone and he always asks me why I\u2019m so sad and I just have to make up some fucking excuse and turn him away at my door while he cries because I won\u2019t hangout with him and he is lonely too because he goes to a German school and has no friends and he\u2019s like the only person I actually care about so I fucking die inside when I see him sad but I just can\u2019t bring myself to hangout with him because I need to be alone. Surprisingly this is what hurts me the most, out of everything\n\nEver since the German school I had considered just killing myself but I have never actually thought about it as a real option because it is waaaayyy too fucking scary. I wrote a suicide note at one point but that was just me being stupid. I could never bring myself to do it. There is another reason why I can\u2019t do it. Throughout all of this, throughout all of the misery and life experiences that have fucked me up. When I am not siting in my room depressed as fuck all day. Those rare occasions when I actually am in a relatively good mood or I visit family somewhere and get to actually associate with people. I am still, the most, outgoing, crazy, energetic, friendly, funny and loving person. So therefore I have a dream. I have this fucking terrifying dream in life. Which I want more than anything to achieve. So I live on, because for some fucking reason, I have this feeling in my heart, that I am going to achieve it. I feel like I know that I am going to do it, despite it being 1 million times bigger than the person I am. So I work hard, to achieve this dream, even though it gets so insanely hard to stay positive sometimes, because it seems like all odds are against me and nobody wants to help me out. Still, I work harder on this than I have ever worked on anything before. Because the idea of working some random desk job is the scariest thing I could ever think of and I will stop at nothing to steer clear of an occupation of the sort. That is my greatest fear: failure. \n\nI am not going to tell you my dream, I am sorry. I just want you to know that once I move back to the US, (because that has been my goal since moving here because I hate Germany with all of my might I am sorry but I hate it so much) I am going to be happy again. Ever since I came here I have yearned to be in the US. My birthplace, where I grew up ... my home. I have been away for too long. So, I look forward to this, as well as working towards my dream once I get there, and that is what keeps me going. And I will keep going. It\u2019s just right now, at this point, I am stuck here in Germany living with my parents because if I stay just 6 more months I will have permanent residency in Europe which my parents basically are forcing me to stay here and get so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t just leave in case you were wondering. It feels just like when I was counting down towards the end of my year of hell at the German school. Which I thought for sure I would never have to experience something that terrible ever again and here I am. The worst thing is I have no idea if this will be the last time I experience one of these hells. My life is probably filled with them. But I have to get through this, otherwise I will never know if I will achieve my life long dream or not. Plus if I don\u2019t I can always just off myself then. I feel like it will be mush less scary at that point. But I have a feeling even if I don\u2019t achieve my dream I will achieve something else along the way.

Before 2007, in 2006, I had a suicide attempt.  This led to me being put on meds, which helped, but it didn't prevent me from losing my job the next year.\n\nMy dream is to be a stand-up comedian.  I did stand-up for about a year before my suicide attempt.  I want to get back into it, but I'm so old.  Way too old to be starting something new.  I've come to the realization that my entire life will be wasted, and I'll never be what I want.\n\nSorry, I just wanted to type that out here.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T02:35:19+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T02:35:20+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebphwa/i_always_feel_like_its_too_late/"}

Every day I wake up and within minutes the mind monster has me with its hatred. I say its hatred, but really the hatred is all mine. I hate myself. At least that is what I tell myself over and over again every day. I try to escape with sleep. I also do positivity meditations, whilst functionally useless, they distract me from the hateful pressure in my own skull. I want to make a hole in my head to let the pressure out. I like that someone else tells me I am ok, because I struggle so hard to tell myself that. I recognised a few years ago that I do not think positively at all. I am full of self-criticism and loathing. So I figured if I cannot give myself positive thoughts then maybe I can listen to some and it will take root and perhaps grow thought patterns that are helpful and compassionate to myself. This has not been the case. I have listened to these saccharine statements for years and there is no improvement. Everyday I wake to the barrage of self-hatred. And the odd thing is I have never done anything that logically deserves self-loathing. I have always tried to help others, I dedicated my younger life to helping kids at risk, I volunteered to help others, have volunteered at an orphanage for kids with special needs, have been there for friends going through difficult times and given food, support and comfort to friends and family. I have done everything I can to prove to the hatred in my head that I am not a bad person. To be clear I have never murdered anyone, raped or abused anyone \u2013 although I have been subjected to abuse and abandonment as a child and was raped as a young adult. Sometimes I wish some one would just kill me; it would save me from having to do it. \n\nI have spent years and years in therapy. From the age of 19 I sought therapy after realising that beating myself daily with a thick leather belt was not overly caring of myself \u2013 although I had framed the self-abuse as \u2018motivation\u2019. I told someone what I did and their horror at my casual abuse of myself was shocking to me. I really didn\u2019t get it at all until I saw it in someone else\u2019s eyes. I then started therapy and self-help courses for years and none of it has worked. None. I despise myself as much as I did back then if not more so because now I have an entire adulthood of struggling with these issues and failing to resolve them. \n\nFor nearly thirty years I have struggled with this poisonous self-hatred and I have got nowhere. In fact, it has only worsened. I am 46 years old now and cannot find work. I feel like I am utterly useless. Every morning I wake up after too little sleep to only have a barrage of recrimination descend on me within moments of opening my eyes and ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN, PREFERABLY PERMANANTLY. \n\nI send out my resume and am lucky to get a rejection. Mostly I am ignored. It has been a couple years now since I held down a proper job. A friend got me a contract, a few months ago and I delivered it, it was a huge project, which really should have gone to a content creation team to complete, I got it done, but the stress was unbelievable. I woke two or three times a night in a cold sweat, but I worked my arse off, got a couple aspects of the project done by contractors and delivered on time. Once it was done, I collapsed, utterly exhausted. I have been pretty much useless since then. \n\nThe only reason I have not opened that hole in my head to let out the pressure is my girl. She is literally the best thing that has happened to me in my life. I could not subject her to the fallout of my suicide. Maybe all that therapy made enough space for her to show up in my life. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t feel this way, I shouldn\u2019t hate myself so much, but I do, and I don\u2019t think it will ever change. I spent my whole life so far trying to stem the tide of self-hatred, but I can\u2019t hold back the ocean with my bare hands.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T02:19:42+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T02:19:44+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebpayt/life_long_depression_and_i_cannot_see_a_way_clear/"}

I flunked out of high school so right there I thought I was already on the wrong track. However, I have tried so many different jobs as the years went on. I went from an office typing hundreds of entry's a day, working as a Cook at a Hotel&amp;Restaurant to working with sheet metal in a construction like setting. I needed help finding out what I wanted to do for a career. So, I turned to Job Corps. I learned how to make delicious food and landed a Hotel Cook job in Las Vegas after my time at Job Corps. The first year working I thought to myself. \"I found out what I wanted for a career. This is tolerable, I can do this.\" However, I was still feeling missing something. I could never figure out what it was. Every day I felt like I was wasting my time and energy into what ever I was doing. Everything that I tried I felt like it didn't matter because my life was still empty with or without a career. I moved from Las Vegas to Oregon to be with my family because I didn't know what else to do for me to feel happier. I was happy for about 1-2 months and it went back to 'normal' again. What I mean by 'normal' is me feeling depressed and useless. You might think I'm exaggerating but I really am not. Every day I would worry about money and my life. So, I would fix the money problem with getting a crappy job. Then after about 2 weeks I would feel even worse than I did without money. So, I didn't know what was happening. I quit many jobs like that. Which turned into dwindling my family's financial because I didn't pay rent and I didn't want to work. Hell I didn't even want to live this life. Sometimes during the drive to work I thought about driving straight into a tree. This is no joke and I don't mean to be like that, but it's the truth. I asked myself this and this goes to a lot of aspects in life. \"Who would do anything if you or the people around you had a worse outcome?\" So, I knew I would never actually drive straight into a tree hoping to end my life. I would hurt many people who cared for me. \n\nI always wondered how people can work a crappy job and feel okay with it and tolerate it. I always thought \"Is this how life feels and people just deal with it?\" \"Am I just different or am I just extremely lazy to a point of depression?\" This took years to figure out why people can work a crappy job and be okay with it. I believe that they are able to work that crappy job because they are passionate about something in their life. I thought that was the case because I found out that I lack passion for anything that was going on in my life. That is when I realized the reason why I get so depressed working a crappy job, because my life was already crappy from no passion.. then I went and smacked it in the face with a 30-40 hour tiring work week. I lacked passion about absolutely anything in my life. So, it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I even had no drive to play my favorite video games because I thought it was pointless and a waste of time. I still played them, but I never really let myself enjoy them. That is when I realized that I need to find something that I am passionate about and make that my main goal in life. To always have passion about something. I took some time to think. I really thought about it.. I thought about all my experiences. What I liked and what I didn't like about them. I finally figured out what I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping people with a life problem. Whenever I can help someone with a really important problem. I just feel like something is lifted. I never thought to notice it before. I have always helped people all throughout my life. I helped my friends with their life problems instead of helping mine most times. I like it when I can make someone else's problem go away. It makes me happier knowing that they don't have to deal with that huge problem that they felt they needed my help on. \n\nThat is why I want to help people find out what they are passionate about. I want to really dig deep into people's experiences like I did with mine and figure out what you enjoyed and did not enjoy about each aspect of your life/work/friends in order to find passion somewhere. I want to figure out what you're passionate about so that you can live a happier life and in return.. help me live a happier life. I believe finding out what your passionate about is what makes you truly feel happiness. With passion you don't care about what happens during the day. Because, you get to go home and really deeply enjoy this one thing that you love. Whether it be work or a hobby. Everyone can be passionate about something. \n\nI'm 27 years old now turning 28 late next year. If you have a similar problem and want help finding out what you're passionate about. Message me on Reddit or leave a comment down below and I'll message you. Like I said I have helped many of my friends with their problems and I would like to help anyone else that I can.

I often find myself missing lessons and skipping days just because I don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m on 68% attendance. My friends have picked up on the fact that I\u2019m distant from them all and as a result I\u2019m often excluded from motives on the weekend and other things. I don\u2019t really have anything to live for. I come home from college and play video games for around 7/8 hours until I fall asleep. And I repeat the same process over and over again. I\u2019m not too sure what I actually should do to fix any of this. I\u2019m not even sure if this is the right subreddit but I guess I\u2019m finally opening up.

Idk why I want to do this I guess I just wanna share something about me with someone cause I don\u2019t get to do that much anymore. I don\u2019t have any experience with this I\u2019ve always been the suffer in silence type I don\u2019t share when I\u2019m sad I always hide it until it goes away as I believe I can get over my problems much easier when it\u2019s just me solving it, instead of people trying to help me who could never know the whole story about me, giving me shitty ideas. No disrespect to them... it just doesn\u2019t help.\n\nI was always a pretty friendly person, just getting through life and having some close friends, nothing really too drastic, until one summer I decided I wanted to be more outgoing and energetic like I was with my family, just all the time. So I changed, and doing so made me so much happier. From then on I was always the most outgoing and crazy person around, I was happy with everyone and everyone loved hanging out with me and I loved it, I felt like I was my true self, it\u2019s what made me happy. I had this neighborhood group of friends which I loved more than anything else in the world. We all lived basically right next to eachother and I spent almost every second of my free time outside hanging out with them, growing up with them, getting into trouble with them, finding ourselves together. I was always the one outside with whoever could be with me, I was always that kid who loved being with people and hanging out. They really made me who I am today.\n\nAfter 6 years of this my family got up and moved us from the United States to Germany. I was a fucking idiot when they brought up the move for the very first time because I got excited and was all for it. I had no idea what the fuck I was really getting myself into, I was only like 13. I didn\u2019t realize the consequences. So yea, we moved. To the middle of nowhere in a village with farm lands and fertilizer tractors riding around stinking up the whole place every Thursday. When someone talks about being in buttfuck nowhere they have never been to this fucking village. There was nobody there, except an old ass senior home with old people everywhere. Nonetheless my dumbass was still optimistic that I was gonna \u201cmake new friends here\u201d and it would be exactly like my neighborhood back in the US just with... german kids.. But no, there were no german kids. There weren\u2019t any kids for that matter, I was all alone. \n\nThere was an international school about 1h30m train ride away from my house where I\u2019d be with people like me and everything would be in English. There was also a German school 15 minutes away which I could go to. So here comes mistake of a lifetime #2, I chose the German school. Worst fucking year of my entire life. Don\u2019t get me wrong I was still outgoing as shit I got along with everybody. But no matter how well you can get along with people throwing shit around acting like hooligans and kicking soccer balls at each others asses, there is no fucking connection, with anyone, when u can\u2019t sit down and have a real ass conversation with them. So here\u2019s where my depression truly started. I was lonely. Life felt like literal hell, I had no connection with anyone I was utterly miserable. The kids thought they were my friends but they had no idea how I was truly feeling under all of the stupid games we would play, and hey, I couldn\u2019t tell them, I was just the crazy american who laughed with them and was surprisingly good at soccer. Like I said, I couldn\u2019t speak their language, they spoke broken English but much too broken for me to open up about my feelings to them. It just wouldn\u2019t make sense. So I struggled through that year every way possible counting down the days and missing about half of the second semester of school due to me being \u201csick\u201d which was basically just me laying in my bed so depressed I couldn\u2019t get up. See I wasn\u2019t actually a student at that school. I was what they called a \u201cGastsch\u00fcler\u201d. Which is basically a guest that joins along in the classes to learn German from everyone and see if they would wanna continue their high school years at the school. Eventually that horrible year ended, and I decided to finally go to the international school despite having to take an 1h30m train ride every morning. I thought life was gonna get good again.\n\nI kinda fit right in at the international school, I made a group of friends who seemed cool, we had all the same interests... relatively. Shitty thing was this school was literally made for geniuses and I was a fucking dumbass so I failed basically everything but it\u2019s private so if you pay you get to get some meaningless certificate anyways so yes I got that, just not the good one, I got the lesser one which apparently isn\u2019t even equivalent to a high school diploma even though my high school was basically only college courses. Yea, shit is fucked up. Anyways, my \u201cfriends\u201d which I finally got after so long, decided to start making group chats without me and hanging out without me even though I was apart of their group so yea they were fucking dickheads and it took me the whole first year at that school to figure out what they were doing. Second year my family actually moved to the same city as my school which was really awesome because I was a 6 minute bike ride away instead of an 1h30 train ride. Problem was, I had no friends again. But I couldn\u2019t just have no friends. So I kept hanging out with those dickheads and I pretended to not notice that they would hangout without me and try and hide their stupid fucking group chats from me even tho it was obvious as fuck. Then everything changed.\n\nI met a girl. She was really amazing and we got along super well. I was always a boys kinda guy I never really had friends which were girls but this girl was different. She was so cool and I just clicked with her more than I had with anyone else before. Let\u2019s just call her Lucy. So Lucy and I eventually started dating and i didn\u2019t have to hangout with those dickheads anymore because I had my new bestfriend Lucy. About 2 months into the relationship she decided she wasn\u2019t happy and wanted to go on a break. I really didn\u2019t want to lose her so I tried to start fixing myself to cater to how she felt so that she would like me again. Which when I look back on it fucked me up a lot mentally. While we were on this break we agreed to not do anything with anyone else and that we would stay loyal. Well, yea. She cheated on me. And after I found out she told me that she just had a \u201cvibe\u201d with this person and that she wanted to see where things would lead with him. I was heartbroken. But obviously not heartbroken enough because 2 weeks later she decided to not pursue her vibe with this one dude and I got back together with her. Like I said, I didn\u2019t have anyone else. We proceeded to date for another year and 5 months. About 5 months in she started acting all batshit crazy and I swear to god she was a fucking psychopath. She always wanted to fight she always was mad at me no matter what I did, I\u2019d spend hours trying to calm her down and make her happy again just for her to flip her shit again within five minutes. But she \u201cloved me so much\u201d. And it felt so good to have someone love me. So I told her I loved her back. I feel really bad about this. Honestly, I don\u2019t really know how I felt. I wanted to love her so bad, I just didn\u2019t really feel it. I hated myself for not feeling it but it just wouldn\u2019t come. But I couldn\u2019t leave her. First of all I had no one else, and I was such a fucking pussy I was so goddamn scared to do it I let this shitty ass miserable relationship go on for so long and it was such a mistake. See being with her made me feel trapped because I wanted to get away from the situation but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nThis gave me crippling anxiety. It started out as a fear of throwing up in front of everyone and whenever I was \u201ctrapped\u201d in a room I would feel like I was going to throw up and it was so fucking scary. Eventually it got worse and turned from the fear of throwing up when I was trapped, to a fear of having a heart attack. Which doesn\u2019t go well with anxiety because anxiety attacks feel like heart attacks and I had anxiety about having a heart attack so yea, you can imagine how that went down. I couldn\u2019t go anywhere where I would feel trapped. I would lose my shit in the movie theatre, I couldn\u2019t concentrate a single second in school, I felt trapped everywhere I went. The one place I was always safe... my room. I was alone and nothing could get to me. But it got me thinking, what could stop me from having a heart attack in my room, there is no difference. So for weeks straight I swear my heart would not stop pounding, the only time it wasn\u2019t was when I was asleep because I couldn\u2019t think about having a heart attack but the second I woke up it was the first think on my mind and my heart would begin pounding again. It would get hard to breathe, it would become hard to eat and to drink, but I never told anyone. I don\u2019t know why, it was hard to think straight. So finally I simply could not take it anymore and I broke up with Lucy after we graduated. I broke her heart, and I didn\u2019t feel a thing. I finally ripped off the bandaid and I couldn\u2019t even cry. I wasn\u2019t able to. I lost the ability to cry at some point throughout my whole journey in Germany. I still can\u2019t. Every once in a while I\u2019ll explode for a few hours but that\u2019s like once every six months. I wish I could always cry, it feels so good, but I can\u2019t. Anyways she hates me now but we moved on and that was the end of that whole thing. I still hate all those dickheads I hung out with before Lucy. I want to move on but they are just such shit people I never met such shit people. I try though.\n\nAnyways, remember my friends from the US. Yea I sort of kept in contact with them after I moved but honestly, I wish I hadn\u2019t. The hardest thing in the world is seeing them on social media still growing up together while I\u2019m here alone miserable as fuck when this is not the life I was supposed to fucking live. I don\u2019t even know who they are anymore and they don\u2019t fucking care to ever talk to me. They would never ask me how I am or anything they just fucking moved on. No one would talk to me unless I would reach out to them only to get dry ass responses. They assume just like everyone else I\u2019ve ever talked to that I am fine because I always act super happy and outgoing around people but once I am alone I couldn\u2019t be sadder, because I have no real friends to talk to. I know they still love me, cause they tell me. But I know they eventually stopped caring about me after I was gone. It hurts so bad. I hate seeing them together without me. I was always there. Now it\u2019s too late they\u2019re all going off to college and done being kids. I just wish we could be kids forever.\n\nSo here I am today. I have absolutely no one in my life except for my family who I love so very much but they are just so fucking annoying. They are such great people but I hate myself so much that I can\u2019t stand them because they know how sad I am and they try to help but it pisses me the fuck off. I don\u2019t want their help they can\u2019t do anything for me they just want to \u201ctalk\u201d and cry with me. I need a peer. My best friend of all time, who I didn\u2019t even mention. My brother who is 9 years younger than me, was my rock throughout everything, but I mean, come on. How happy can I be hanging out with an 8 year old all day. It hurts so bad to turn him down because he looks up to me so much but I don\u2019t want to play legos all day, I want to be alone and he always asks me why I\u2019m so sad and I just have to make up some fucking excuse and turn him away at my door while he cries because I won\u2019t hangout with him and he is lonely too because he goes to a German school and has no friends and he\u2019s like the only person I actually care about so I fucking die inside when I see him sad but I just can\u2019t bring myself to hangout with him because I need to be alone. Surprisingly this is what hurts me the most, out of everything\n\nEver since the German school I had considered just killing myself but I have never actually thought about it as a real option because it is waaaayyy too fucking scary. I wrote a suicide note at one point but that was just me being stupid. I could never bring myself to do it. There is something else. Another reason why I can\u2019t do it. The reason is that throughout all of this, throughout all of the misery and life experiences that have fucked me up. When I am not siting in my room depressed as fuck all day. Those rare occasions when I actually am in a relatively good mood or I visit family somewhere and get to actually associate with people that say they care about me. I am still, the most outgoing, crazy, energetic, friendly, funny and loving person. So therefore I have a dream. I have this fucking terrifying dream in life. Which I want more than anything to achieve. So I live on, because for some fucking reason, I have this feeling in my heart, that I am going to achieve it. I feel like I know that I am going to do it, despite it being 1 million times bigger than the person I am. So I work hard, to achieve this dream, even though it gets so insanely hard to stay positive sometimes, because it seems like all odds are against me and nobody wants to help me out. Still, I work harder on this than I have ever worked on anything before. Because the idea of working some random desk job is the scariest thing I could ever think of and I will stop at nothing to steer clear of an occupation of the sort. That is my greatest fear: failure. \n\nI am not going to tell you my dream, I am sorry. I just want you to know that once I move back to the US, (because that has been my goal since moving here because I hate Germany with all of my might I am sorry but I hate it so much) I am going to be happy again. Ever since I came here I have yearned to be in the US. My birthplace, where I grew up ... my home. I have been away for too long. So, I look forward to this, as well as working towards my dream once I get there, and that is what keeps me going. And I will keep going. It\u2019s just right now, at this point, I am stuck here in Germany living with my parents because if I stay just 6 more months I will have permanent residency in Europe which my parents basically are forcing me to stay here and get so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t just leave in case you were wondering. It feels just like when I was counting down towards the end of my year of hell at the German school. Which I thought for sure I would never have to experience something that terrible ever again and here I am. The worst thing is I have no idea if this will be the last time I experience one of these hells. My life is probably filled with them. But I have to get through this, otherwise I will never know if I will achieve my life long dream or not. Plus if I don\u2019t I can always just off myself then. I feel like it will be mush less scarier at that point. But I have a feeling even if I don\u2019t achieve my dream I will achieve something else along the way. Perhaps something that I didn\u2019t necessarily want, but the one thing that I always needed, I just never knew.\n\nI wanted to write this because I was feeling insanely depressed and I have really been needing someone to talk to lately, despite me being better off alone. I just haven\u2019t had anyone for quite some time. It actually felt really good to write this out, I didn\u2019t expect that. If you actually read all of this I really appreciate you.

{"id": "eborx0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eborx0/to_anyone_struggling/", "title": "TO ANYONE STRUGGLING", "author": "dominusnine", "selftext": "So, I started to write a comment on someone's post about how they believe it inevitable that they will someday kill themselves, and then it got a little out of hand. I just wanted to make a post with my original comment in the hopes that it will reach, and hopefully help someone, anyone at all. It is addressed to the OP of the post, but the message is for anyone struggling and feeling hopeless. I'm right there with you, and I don't want you or I or anyone else to suffer like this.\n\nHere is the comment:\n\n\\~\n\nHey...\n\nHow old are you? No, age doesn't really have to affect this at all. You can be young or you can be old, poor or rich, lonely or surrounded by friends, successful or a complete \"failure\" by your own standards (or that of others, and f\\*\\*\\* what they say, honestly. They don't know you!), but what really matters is that little spark inside your own brain.\n\nYOU!\n\nYou control those thoughts, whether you believe it or not. I have now been at my absolute worst. I can sit here and question, \"Was that really the worst? What if it comes again, and what if this time--\" ... You have to not let yourself think that way.\n\nThere was someone here on Reddit a long time ago, or maybe it was elsewhere.. They left what they probably thought was a very simple comment, yet it really spoke loudly to me. They said, \"The brain has fire-hose sized neural pathways towards negative thought and emotion, and it has hair-width thin neural pathways towards all that is positive.\"\n\nFor someone struggling with severe, seemingly incurable depression, this sunk in. It made me realize, wait... I can control this. It's just extremely difficult. But, that doesn't mean it is impossible. Now, your brain might be thinking, \"Ok, well, maybe this is true. But, I know how much more the depression hurts when I try my hardest,\" because we take the easy route for a reason - It is less taxing on our nerves and our psyche, \"So, if I try my hardest, and expend all my mental and emotional energy towards this light at the end of the tunnel--that I don't know for sure I will ever be able to reach--and it turns out that I fall hard, REALLY HARD, all the way back to ground zero, I just KNOW I will have to kill myself then.\"\n\n...I've been here. I've had the same pattern of thoughts. I've sat and thought, with the belief that it is true, \"It will either be a choice, or it will be a moment of such severe, such IMMENSE pain, that you can't control it, or yourself, and you will find any way out of that pain, whether it's taking a bunch of pills, finding the nearest hig-hrise, opening the gun-safe, or running into the road after running, crying, manically and hysterically, with no destination or purpose because you are that lost and that pained from life.\"\n\nThat's how I have believed my life/death will play out. And you know what? I'm not coming from a place of \"been there, done that, now I'm past it.\" No.. I had one of these moments last night. And I'm telling you, this life will seem as dark as your mind's eye says it is. Sometimes that eye is shut because it needs rest. It sees too much pain inside of us, and that night air outside seems to just carry nothing but a lack of hope, a deep darkness and the foreboding, lingering feeling of a day that will make us regret ever going to sleep tonight without the plan of not waking up in the morning... And yet, another you, a you that might exist tomorrow, will feel the calmness in that night's breeze. You'll look outside and feel that night air calmly remind you of one more day that you GET to have on this Earth and make the most of it.\n\nThere's pain now. It's heavy.\n\nIt doesn't have to stay.\n\nI'm there with you. I told myself last night--I told OTHERS last night, who tried to help me--that, \"I don't see the point. The effort it is going to take and the way it is going to drain me is going to leave me weaker for that next moment that blows up into a chaos of pure depression and hopelessness. What is the point of life if it is an enormous amount of pain every day just to find that one moment, that little sliver of happiness somewhere in the future that fades just as quickly again once it's over..?\"\n\nIf I had let myself blow my brains out last night, as I very desperately wanted to, I would have hurt someone who means more than this world to me. Yeah, the world's shit sometimes, so maybe that doesn't mean much. Let's see. Let's say they mean more than my pride... They mean more than the ability to let go. They mean more than it means to me to give myself an excuse. They mean more to me than to need happiness for 11 years. I would be a martyr in for pain for them in this LIFE, because it would be the opposite of what a martyr normally is. I wouldn't be dying for them. I would be doing what is much more difficult. I would be staying ALIVE for them, despite anything. This person doesn't have to be your S.O. Maybe it's your Twin Flame, your best friend, a family member.\n\nSometimes we don't have anybody. When I was 19, I had given up on being romantic. I didn't think anyone could ever love me again. I thought I was unattractive. I thought many lowly things of myself. And yet I had some small, strange little pride in myself that I was better than anyone mentally. It didn't help me stay alive. It made me believe I was in a world that I didn't agree with or feel I belong in. Guess, what I still feel I don't agree with this world, but I belong here because this is Earth. This is where humans were planted by the universe. They make their own trouble, and I don't have to be a part of it. I have my own trouble. Regardless, when I was 19, I was still a hopeless romantic, but some part of me gave up. The next thing I knew, I was 24, and I had been single for 5 years. I didn't date a single person. I didn't even have sex. I only visited with some very un-close friends about once a month. (That was my choice. I have never been very social.) I realized, or thought, that I lacked a lot of relationship experience because of these 5 years lacking, and then I found I had something that not many others did. I had the experience of a relationship with myself. I discovered my own thoughts and who I truly felt like I was. It wasn't the Me that others imposed on me. It was a me that was very deep, very profound, and yet still with many immature, misplaced thoughts and opinions. When I dated again, I experienced strange, small jealousies over things that shouldn't affect me. I experienced a lack of will towards certain things, certain activities, and found other people's company to still be an annoyance at times. I beat myself up for it--BUT THE POINT IS: I have been suicidal while completely alone, and I have been suicidal while someone is even dating me and making me feel like the world... When I was about 22-24, I realized it was myself that was worth living for. I recognized my dreams and potential, and I was a new person. I never, ever in a million years thought that I could be that kind of positive person. ..And guess what..? It DID bottom out. I lost all of that positivity after my 25th birthday at the very end of 2014. 2015 was a dark year for me. I still haven't bounced back yet. I want to find myelf, the me that was here at 24, and part of the reason it is extremely difficult is because of things out of my control: my health.\n\nMy health had really contributed to a downfall that I didn't bother stopping. I gave up on many places in my life and just considered them un-salvageable, and I devoted myself to causes for other people that were not only entirely self destructive to myself, but that didn't aid others either in the way that I intended. I left behind the most important person to have ever entered my life back then out of that lack of hope. Abandoning them was my soul's way of saying, \"Well, I'm going to die anyway. They're me essentially. They are my happiness and my survival, so... I'll see you in the next life, my friend. 'Maybe on the Dark Side we will be together.' ...Until then...\" And from there, of course I was bound to fail. I made myself a martyr in the wrong way and for the wrong purpose. I devoted my life to my inevitable fate, to the inevitable fate that we ALL face: Death...\n\nThis is a long speech to say this, but I feel that when someone feels that they wish to die, whether it's right-the-hell-now, or far-unto-the-future, they deserve more than just a few words. They deserve to see someone is willing to give them their story and not for the sake of telling their story, but for the sake of sharing a message. My message:\n\nBe a martyr until you find that happiness, but not a martyr that sacrifices your life. Don't plan to die. Plan to live. Don't sacrifice your life. Sacrifice that inherent (and sometimes very unhealthy need, for us struggling with suicidal thoughts and depression) need to feel that \"happiness around the corner\" RIGHT NOW... If you don't feel it right now, maybe there is something missing, just maybe, and you can't tell yourself it will never come. Also, don't rely on it. I used to have ambitions and dreams of such grandeur that I could never live up to, the kind that rely on such circumstance that not many in life get to achieve...\n\n... Every time I give a speech like this, no matter what I say, I always feel it is not enough. I can't reach out and hold your hand and keep you in this world. I know what it's like, and I know what it's like when nothing helps. Just remember, I'm struggling right beside you. It was my birthday yesterday. I am 30 years, 22 hours, and 11 minutes old.\n\nI never thought I would make it to be 30. I never thought I would make it to be 20, or even 18, 17, 16... This life sure is tough. It's even tougher for those like us.\n\nI try to always offer this, and it's rare anyone accepts the invitation, and that's quite alright, but... If you need to talk, I'm here. I'm not someone who's \"been there, done that.\" .. I'm someone who has been there and is still there, and who just happens to have a will that is so incredibly strong because it is fighting a pain so immensely great even as I write this.\n\nI won't die from suicide. I won't let myself. It would betray everything I stand for. When I was single, had no one in this world, I can remember moments that I felt more proud than anytime in my life. I was me, and no one could take that from me.\n\nNow, I have someone I care deeply for. I care for them in a way that not many people get to experience in this life, and you know what? I may lose them. I may lose them due to my lack of hope over the past year, and the depths I have let myself and my life sink to.\n\nIf I lose them, I'll be okay. As long as they are alive, I'll be okay. And even if they died? ..I'm going to pretend--no, not pretend, I'm going to KNOW--that they are watching me, holding my hand, waiting for me, and that the longer I live, the longer I strive on and the more I THRIVE in this life, the happier I will make them and the bigger that smile is that I will bring to their face. They could marry someone else, and I wouldn't even care. They're no less mine, and I'm no less theirs. It's a connection that just can't be broken.\n\nNot everyone gets to have that connection, and you don't need it. I didn't need it before I found it, and please, anyone reading this: DO NOT ENVY IT OR CRAVE IT... Loving someone so deeply does not always make life easier. It can make it HARDER... You know how hard it is to live? Being just yourself is one thing. Now imagine two of you. It's immense pressure. It's incredibly difficult. But, I won't give up. So, I'm extending my hope to you, OP, and to all reading this, and I can already feel all those of you who extend your hope to me as well, so thank you.\n\nLet's all stay alive for one another, but most of all, let's stay alive for OURSELVES.\n\nWhen sadness so great comes at you with it's knives and daggers, digging into you, making this life unbearable, stand tall and say whatever curse word, whatever statement of strength you need to tell it off. Tell it that it doesn't not own you. It's the bad side of your conscience trying to drag you down, and you're stronger than it. I've never felt better about myself than when I can be the strongest during moments of the most immense pain. I'm not happy right now. I'm feeling solace. It's not an unrealistic hope or a numbness to the pain I'm feeling right now. It's just gathering that will to survive.\n\nAnd, lastly... You need to question not only moments of pure sorrow, but also of unrealistic, surprising and overwhelming feelings of happiness or contentment as well. When those come, don't just set yourself back into a sadness by telling yourself they aren't real. If necessary, or if it works for you, simply tell those happy feelings the same thing. Laugh in its face, and say, \"(Hahahaha!) You think I'm just sticking around here for you? No. I'm here to live. I'm here to experience the highs and the lows and to let it give birth to creativity, to growth, to a better life.\"\n\n... That's all.\n\nDream as if you have forever.\n\nLive as if you have only today.\n\nLove the ones you love as if you only have them for today. Love them as if you will never see them or hear from them again. Never question them. Let them be free. Give them everything that you would wish them to give to you.\n\nAnd give yourself those same things.\n\nDon't wait for someone else to come along and give it to you.\n\nLife isn't easy. Do you want to die having not tried at all? Or do you want to die on your feet, fighting? Your life is an invisible war, and you don't need fame. Be your own hero in that war and save yourself. You're worth it.\n\nDon't wait for life to give you that \"Chance.\"\n\nJUST TAKE IT.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T01:37:09+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T01:37:11+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eborx0/to_anyone_struggling/"}

I\u2019ve never done a long post like this before and I don\u2019t know how to organise my thoughts. \n\nI can be happy. I watch stuff, can laugh around people, all that stuff - but the second that I\u2019m alone or have a moment to think, I just go sad and numb, and I feel a sinking feeling in my stomach. \n\nI distract myself by mainly watching TV and scrolling through social media. I don\u2019t like doing this, but it\u2019s all I can bring myself to do for hours or days at a time. At the end of the day I hate that that\u2019s all I\u2019ve done but a lot of the time I can\u2019t motivate myself to move and do things. \n\nI know for sure I\u2019ve felt this way since the end of 2016, but I think it was happening before then but I just didn\u2019t recognise it. \n\nI can\u2019t start anything. I want desperately to have passion for something. There are so many things I want to do - filmmaking, stand up comedy, travelling, but I just cannot summon the will to start any of these things, and it\u2019s really upsetting. I buy stuff to try and get myself to do it, but then a year later it just makes me upset knowing I haven\u2019t done anything with them. \n\nI also genuinely don\u2019t think I have many friends. There are plenty of people I\u2019m friendly and civil with. But no one ever messages me or invites me to anything. Hell, a group of my housemates from university travelled 60 miles to the city where I\u2019m living currently for a night out and didn\u2019t tell me. I genuinely think that everyone is indifferent to whether I\u2019m around or not. \n\nNobody knows anything about me. I\u2019ve been so scared of both opening up to people as well as trying these new things that I don\u2019t have a personality. I\u2019m just a blank slate in the eyes of most people I know. It really gets to me, I\u2019ve known people for years and they don\u2019t know anything about me. \n\nI strongly hate everything about myself. I hate the way my mind works, as a result of all this bad thinking I think it\u2019s pushed people away. I\u2019m the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been. I managed to lose 20KG from being 90KG and was pretty happy with where I was, but I have a bad relationship with food and so over the past year I\u2019ve put all the weight back on and am currently somewhere around 97KG (I don\u2019t know exactly because I can\u2019t bring myself to weigh myself). I can\u2019t stand the sight of myself. I\u2019m the most self-conscious I\u2019ve ever been and I hate being around people who saw me when I was slimmer. I think I look disgusting. \n\nI get really upset by things recently as well. I saw a post the other day about how much easier it is to lose weight with a gym buddy and it made me remember that I\u2019ve never had someone close enough that would go with me. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious enough to be classed as depression though. I can force myself out of bed when I have something to do, like work. And whenever I read other people\u2019s stories about it, it always sounds a lot more debilitating than what I\u2019m feeling. I genuinely think half the time that I\u2019m just sad but I can\u2019t make it better. \n\nI\u2019m booking myself in with an appointment with a counsellor.

Had a super weird childhood and it wasn\u2019t bad like I had the middle class experience but just shitty family situations especially with my dad that have left me with so many insecurities and a lot of anger.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna harp on the weird stuff from when I was younger and the situations with my dad and his wives but my depression became more frequent when I finally moved in with my dad my freshman year after him being in and out of my life because of the military and him finally retiring opened up a chance to actually get to know him. He had 7 deployments as a TACP in the AF so at the time not counting his TDY and him just not wanting to be around my mom he hadn\u2019t been around me for most of my life with me about to turn 14 when I moved in with him.\n\nI remember being so excited to get to know him because I always idolized him. I remember football being our common interest and I played through most of high school and always tried to impress him. I really began feeling insecure when he wasn\u2019t really wanting to bond with me or anything he just wanted to go out with his second wife at the time. I remember tweaking my shoulder my sophomore year on a bad arm tackle on my part and my dad not really bothering to do much about it. I still have a messed up right shoulder. This is a sign of what was to come with my dad. \n\nHe divorced my stepmom at the time and it was a big shock because he promised stability when I moved in with him because all my childhood was moving around and him being like a stranger to me so it hurt a little but I sucked it up and would just agree to everything to try and make him happy and have some middle ground. I always and still for some reason felt like I owed him something and it genuinely hurts knowing I thought I\u2019d stop feeling that around 14-15 and here I am still carrying the weight of it. That aside, the spring semester of my sophomore year we got an apartment and I transferred to my second of four high schools I\u2019d go to. My dad promised there\u2019d be guy time and that didn\u2019t last. He\u2019d always say I\u2019d never want to hang out but when he would do something with me, which was always the same thing, go to Buffalo Wild Wings and have the most awkward and forced conversations in between our NFL banter (the only thing we can talk about). \n\nI remember around mid to late April of that year my dad has started dating a girl in Arizona and would fly out to see her every here and there. At that point I was like whatever, and thought it was nice having the place to myself. Until, at one point he went out of town and his ex/second wife is at the door crying about the divorce because it was still in process while they were separated. It hurt me because she was a good woman and it just didn\u2019t work for my dad because he wanted younger and flashier I\u2019m not going to pretend I couldn\u2019t tell why he divorced her. I texted my dad and he just said to turn the lights off and don\u2019t leave and his ex wife just stood out there crying for hours and then I spent the rest of my night crying too. For some reason I felt it was my fault and I always have an inclination to feel this way. I later found out my dad has included me in a lie saying that me and him were on a camping trip together. As to why his ex wife came to the apartment when he told that is beyond me but my dad also includes me in this same lie later with the girl from Arizona. \n\nIn June a few months later, my dad is about to end it with Arizona girl and he didn\u2019t come home for 3-4 days and I find out from his Instagram (he\u2019s a younger dad. Early 40\u2019s) he has a new girl friend. I didn\u2019t say anything about him being gone when he came back but I was confused and hurt and began to realize he didn\u2019t care at that point. This girl he started dating out of nowhere is now his current fianc\u00e9 and she enabled him to care less and less about his kids. Funny thing is that my dad has his Arizona girlfriend over one last time in mid June (flew her in) and told his current fianc\u00e9/third wife that me and him were camping. I remember finding that out in April of 2018 at my grandmas funeral in front of him and the look on his face when he realized. He got the benefit of the doubt when I was crying around family because his mom passed. \n\nGoing back from that June however, I continued at the same school until October when my dad moved me (he left me alone in that apartment after the summer began because he was always at his fianc\u00e9s part of town) to a townhouse right by his fianc\u00e9s. She had kids and my dad always stayed over there and said I was always welcome to hang out there too but I always get uncomfortable and out of place. It hurt how he wanted to go out every night with his fianc\u00e9 but would be like \u201cseriously?\u201d If I asked him to sign something for school. Now I\u2019m at school #3 and that\u2019s when my confidence took a big hit. Junior year I quit football and got into music which my dad was never supportive of, or anything really except the military. I stayed in the town house by his fianc\u00e9s and just did my own thing and worked. \n\nThat summer my dad and his fianc\u00e9 get a house and so I\u2019m on to school #4 and at this point I just stopped caring. The depression and feelings i had since my freshman year moving in with him were turned to pure anger. Senior year was the angriest year of my life and for good measure. I tore my ACL and meniscus playing basketball in early August of 2018 and my dad and I didn\u2019t know as I was pretty healthy and never got hurt but he refused to take me to the hospital when I begged him. I started my fourth school on crutches and was extremely shy and introverted which was a slow change from how I was such an extroverted kid through elementary and middle school. Eventually I could walk on my bad leg with no crutches but my knee felt wrong the whole time. I finally got an MRI on December and found out it was my ACL and meniscus and my doctor was shocked but said it was common for some people to go on and not know so I guess that had to have made my dad forget how he totally ignored my request to literally get my leg fixed. \n\nEnded my senior year and moved out. I\u2019ve been bitter since the beginning of that year. I can\u2019t join the military because I tried getting a waiver for my knee surgeries and due to the circumstances of my ACL and meniscus tears and how my rehab wasn\u2019t smooth. I was furious. I loved to run and work out and now I feel like that\u2019s another piece of me missing. I\u2019ve been so miserable and I wish every day I could just start a new life as a new person. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in a different country being born in Africa, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s wherever to whoever. I just want a chance at another life and not feeling and harboring these feelings of cold anger and gut tightening depression. I\u2019ve tried religion but it never worked for me. Went to church for a year during my freshman year every Sunday during my dads second marriage and that\u2019s the closest I ever got and every time I try again it feels pointless. I don\u2019t think I could ever kill myself because of my mom and little sister and my uncle on my moms side that\u2019s been a dad to me, but I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to dying if some accident happens you know? I used to have recurring dreams when I was in middle school of a home invasion and me usually trying to fight back and wake up. The dream eventually turned towards me letting myself get \u201cshot\u201d and just wake up. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it when I was younger and I haven\u2019t had a dream like that since I was in 7th grade probably but I seriously would just let someone kill me like that (please don\u2019t interpret that as suicide by cop). I wish I could afford therapy on my own and part of me doesn\u2019t want to have to tell this all again because it brings out the most raw feelings I\u2019ve felt and it only makes me angrier.

I flunked out of high school so right there I thought I was already on the wrong track. However, I have tried so many different jobs as the years went on. I went from an office typing hundreds of entry's a day, working as a Cook at a Hotel&amp;Restaurant to working with sheet metal in a construction like setting. I needed help finding out what I wanted to do for a career. So, I turned to Job Corps. I learned how to make delicious food and landed a Hotel Cook job in Las Vegas after my time at Job Corps. The first year working I thought to myself. \"I found out what I wanted for a career. This is tolerable, I can do this.\" However, I was still feeling missing something. I could never figure out what it was. Every day I felt like I was wasting my time and energy into what ever I was doing. Everything that I tried I felt like it didn't matter because my life was still empty with or without a career. I moved from Las Vegas to Oregon to be with my family because I didn't know what else to do for me to feel happier. I was happy for about 1-2 months and it went back to 'normal' again. What I mean by 'normal' is me feeling depressed and useless. You might think I'm exaggerating but I really am not. Every day I would worry about money and my life. So, I would fix the money problem with getting a crappy job. Then after about 2 weeks I would feel even worse than I did without money. So, I didn't know what was happening. I quit many jobs like that. Which turned into dwindling my family's financial because I didn't pay rent and I didn't want to work. Hell I didn't even want to live this life. Sometimes during the drive to work I thought about driving straight into a tree. This is no joke and I don't mean to be like that, but it's the truth. I asked myself this and this goes to a lot of aspects in life. \"Who would do anything if you or the people around you had a worse outcome?\" So, I knew I would never actually drive straight into a tree hoping to end my life. I would hurt many people who cared for me. \n\nI always wondered how people can work a crappy job and feel okay with it and tolerate it. I always thought \"Is this how life feels and people just deal with it?\" \"Am I just different or am I just extremely lazy to a point of depression?\" This took years to figure out why people can work a crappy job and be okay with it. I believe that they are able to work that crappy job because they are passionate about something in their life. I thought that was the case because I found out that I lack passion for anything that was going on in my life. That is when I realized the reason why I get so depressed working a crappy job, because my life was already crappy from no passion.. then I went and smacked it in the face with a 30-40 hour tiring work week. I lacked passion about absolutely anything in my life. So, it was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I even had no drive to play my favorite video games because I thought it was pointless and a waste of time. I still played them, but I never really let myself enjoy them. That is when I realized that I need to find something that I am passionate about and make that my main goal in life. To always have passion about something. I took some time to think. I really thought about it.. I thought about all my experiences. What I liked and what I didn't like about them. I finally figured out what I am passionate about. I am passionate about helping people with a life problem. Whenever I can help someone with a really important problem. I just feel like something is lifted. I never thought to notice it before. I have always helped people all throughout my life. I helped my friends with their life problems instead of helping mine most times. I like it when I can make someone else's problem go away. It makes me happier knowing that they don't have to deal with that huge problem that they felt they needed my help on. \n\nThat is why I want to help people find out what they are passionate about. I want to really dig deep into people's experiences like I did with mine and figure out what you enjoyed and did not enjoy about each aspect of your life/work/friends in order to find passion somewhere. I want to figure out what you're passionate about so that you can live a happier life and in return.. help me live a happier life. I believe finding out what your passionate about is what makes you truly feel happiness. With passion you don't care about what happens during the day. Because, you get to go home and really deeply enjoy this one thing that you love. Whether it be work or a hobby. Everyone can be passionate about something. \n\nI'm 27 years old now turning 28 late next year. If you have a similar problem and want help finding out what you're passionate about. Message me on Reddit or leave a comment down below and I'll message you. Like I said I have helped many of my friends with their problems and I would like to help anyone else that I can. This is what I am passionate about, so help me.. help you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks,\n\nCody", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T00:48:19+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T00:48:20+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebo5zr/hello_reddit_i_want_to_write_this_out_so_maybe_i/"}

Sorry, it's a long post. And it's a lot of relationship stuff but it touched heavily on my mental issues so I hope this is an okay place to post it. These are my thoughts and I just want to share.\n\nI suffer a bit from depression and a lot from anxiety, mostly social anxiety, and I have a lot of difficulty making new friends or getting new people who I grow to love to stay in my life. As a result, I literally only have two actual friends and my family to depend on. My family is kind of nutty sometimes. My mom and I are close and I think my sister and I get closer with every day that passes, but we have a bit of a complicated and painful history involving my grandmother and aunt which I will not go into.\n\nUsually I'm alright and actually quite happy, or if not, I'm neutral or content (or maybe I've just gotten really good at ignoring when I'm mildly sad or unhappy). I don't struggle with loneliness much anymore; I think I've just learned to enjoy being alone a little bit. I do always crave love, though.\n\nSince I've gotten myself to a better state after high school, I like to refer to myself as \"always living on the edge of depression, staring into the darkness but never falling in.\" Well, this past year and 4 or so months I've fallen in quite a lot, due to drama with my boyfriend (now ex. Officially and for the last time). We really loved each other (I still love him), but due to his family being batshit crazy, we couldn't be together. We couldn't stay away from each other though, so we had a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes is was a mild \"we'll be friends but we can't see each other as often or be alone\", and other times it was an extreme \"we can't talk or see each other at all anymore\". Both ended with us finding our way back to each other, and they caused various levels of.... less than favourable moods for me. The latter was the last and most extreme one in which I became more depressed than I've ever been, because of the circumstances around our breakup and the fact that this man has become my best friend and who I loved so much, and now suddenly he's gone with no contact and I can't get out of bed or stop crying and at some point I started lightly self harming to see what it would feel like and whether I can go through with actually drawing blood and not just scratching my arm to shreds with scissors and the people I had met and thought were my friends weren't there for me when I needed them most and my mom and sister didn't know how to help me. I think it's the lowest I've ever fallen and darkest I've ever been. \n\nOh, a notable detail. I don't see therapists cause they don't help me. Either we don't click or they can't see through the bullshit I pull up as a defense or I have trouble reaching them in which they give up on me, but nontheless they don't help. So I've learned to pull myself together when I need to.\n\nAnyway, this time I couldn't pull myself together when I needed to the most. I didn't get better until I caved and messaged him again, and for fear of getting that low again, I asked him if we can just have a low key thing going on and try not to be too serious so that we can figure out how we really feel until we become independent and he doesn't need to listen to his family anymore (we're both in university and he's finishing his last year next year). I realise it's not healthy, but we went through with it and I don't know what he did but I did some intense soul searching the 4 or so months that it lasted. I let myself look at other guys and imagine life without him. I questioned every little quirk and asked myself if I REALLY wanted to live with it for the rest of my life. I let myself dwell on his imperfections. The answer to whether I wanted to live with it was always yes and thinking of moving on with someone else always hurt, but I let myself seriously consider it.\n\nUltimately, the choice was taken away from me, because last week he told me very carefully and gently that he isn't attracted to me anymore. Basically, what he wants has changed, or in his mind he moved on because of all of the hurt and complications we've had to go through. Point is, it is what it is and he doesn't want to be affectionate anymore. \n\nI... took it way better than I thought I would. I asked him for the last time if we can be friends, because the fact is that he is my best friend and I don't want to touch the darkness that goes with losing him again. He agreed and we agreed that there will be no more affection. And this time it's real. I can feel how real it is.\n\nAnd I'm... okay? I cried a few times, of course. I picture him with another girl and I hurt. My pride is hurt. I feel a little unwanted and ugly. I'm craving a rebound. I miss him. \n\nBut it's so unbelievably manageable that I'm shocked at myself. The darkness that I've been fearing isn't here (yet), and it feels how I think a normal breakup my age should feel like. It feels so completely liberating. And I'm okay.\n\nSorry for the long post but I wanted to try to share how I'm feeling and how much it means to me, and I can't go this deep into how low I've been anywhere else.

She constantly cheated on me constantly and lied to me all the time (such as saying she had cancer) and I believed her because I craved her affection and validation no matter how toxic it was. That sweet scent and soft touch blinded me from the long the long term effects of her lies and abuse. We were \u201ctegether\u201d for over 2 years and I skipped an entire semester and I lost every friend I had. Now I have one single friend who\u2019s like an older brother. I managed to graduate by the skin of my teeth. Honestly my diploma was handed to me without me actually putting much effort in at all. \n\nI\u2019m 20 and I have one dream and that\u2019s to a sailor in the US Navy. I\u2019ve been working with a nurse practitioner to regulate my medications (this is important). This N.P. Just so happens to be a corpsman (doctor) in the Navy reserve. She is willing to write a letter of recommendation that she has done for past clients who ended up joining the military. Only if I show progress though is she willing to do this. I\u2019ve bounced from shitty job to shitty job and I\u2019ve barely what you\u2019d call progress. \n\nHERE WHERE DEPRESSION COMES INTO PLAY\n\nI fart leaving my ex-girlfriend would fix all my problems but it just insinuated the loneliness I inevitably felt and every day I find myself laying in bed doing nothing I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s depression or if it\u2019s a lack of motivation or a combination of both. I gained almost 40 pounds from that relationship so I\u2019m horribly overweight by military standards and I\u2019ve come to hate myself for letting myself go through that. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m drowning but I can still breathe. It seems like nothing will change. I  Cancel all my parents to find out any of this or else it\u2019ll set my progress but so far and I\u2019ll be back at square one and I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be prepared to take that step even if it is the best step for me to take. \n\nAfter I broke up with my ex me and my parents got really close again and I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I\u2019m pretty much completely rely on them to survive even though I\u2019m in my 20s now which is pathetic I\u2019m terrified of losing them since they\u2019re both about to hit 70 and I just want to make them proud but I feel like I\u2019ll never do it I feel like I\u2019m constantly letting everyone down.\n\nI don\u2019t know what this post is turned into I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m over sharing I just needed a place to rant.

I always see people saying like \u201coh don\u2019t compare what you\u2019re going through to what someone else is going through because it\u2019s not a competition we\u2019re all deserving of support\u201d and whatever, and I totally agree, but like how can I NOT compare my struggles to other people\u2019s struggles?? I\u2019ve never even had a real fucking job before for Christ\u2019s sake, I have NO IDEA how hard real life is. \n\nPeople have dealt with so much worse than this and I know I shouldn\u2019t think that, but I do.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all I ever think. All I ever think is god you\u2019re pathetic you don\u2019t even deserve to feel sad, you\u2019ve never even done anything hard in your life. Talking about \u201cdepression\u201d like give me a break Jesus Christ..\n\nHere\u2019s another cool fact, I am SO behind in school. I stopped caring somewhere around grade 10 for some reason, yeah good idea let\u2019s just decide to stop caring about school work lol let\u2019s see where that gets you buddy...\n\nThe only friends I\u2019ve ever had were in grade 4-5. And YES I mean that very literally. No I didn\u2019t get  fake friends or anything like that, I mean literally no one, not one single friend from then until high school. \n\nNobody\u2019s fault but my own. I never fucking learned how to interact with people. I don\u2019t know how to start a conversation, don\u2019t know what to say, I don\u2019t even know how friends act towards each other. I just never bothered because I figured friends weren\u2019t important and I was doing everyone a favour by not trying to be friends with them, because I was sparing them from wasting time getting to know me.\n\nWhen you get to high school everyone\u2019s already in friend groups and shit and it\u2019s like, why even bother? What do I have to offer these people? Nothing, absolutely nothing and I should just shut the fuck up and focus on my school work. They play sports or they like art or they play music, they actually do stuff and have stories to talk about. I don\u2019t have any of that. I don\u2019t do shit or have shit to say. I\u2019m not unique in any way.\n\nThat was a really sucky time, when I had stopped caring about my school work. When I got good grades it just meant nothing to me, I didn\u2019t feel any sense of accomplishment, I was never proud of myself despite my teachers telling me I should be, I was just like what the fuck is the point of any of this. I started skipping all my classes because I just couldn\u2019t do anything anymore, it wasn\u2019t even in the cool rebellious I don\u2019t give a shit way it was like I skipped class but stayed in the school and just hid in the bathroom stalls and cried my eyes out until it was time to go home like a little loser boy.\n\nIf I was an emoji I would be this emoji \ud83d\ude10 that\u2019s my personality. Actually even that mouth shows too much emotion.\n\n\ud83d\ude36 This is me, this is me as an emoji I am no mouth emoji nobody wants to be friends with no mouth emoji because he has no personality or emotion booo!\n\nThings have been getting worse recently because it started off like, \u201coh I\u2019m depressed but at least I got diagnosed with depression and yes I understand everything that is happening to me and why I feel this way and yes I still am in touch with my surroundings!\u201d\n\nBut now it\u2019s just like, ooooouuuuuggggghhhhh...\n\nThats the sound, that\u2019s the only way I can describe this feeling to you. It\u2019s like when you take a shower at 3 am and dissociate super hard, except it\u2019s like... all the time, like you feel like that all the time even outside of the shower.\n\nAnd at some point I think I walked out of that shower and I just never stopped feeling that way.\n\nI don\u2019t even feel alive anymore I just feel like I\u2019m just some kind of ghost that\u2019s controlling a body. Very poorly by the way. Like you know those funny indie games with the bad physics, the bad controls, that\u2019s me that\u2019s my body, I\u2019m like hand simulator in real life.\n\nThis might be from weed but my whole life recently has just been a big derealization episode. (If you don\u2019t know what derealization is, look that shit up it fucking sucks) That shit SUCKS (it sucks) and sometimes I\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night and just be like FUCK I\u2019m sinking into the floor?????? And then I\u2019ll go lock myself in the bathroom and breathe really heavy and cry and get scared I\u2019m gonna have a heart attack and die because my heart is beating too fast.\n\nI have the worst memory, the worst sleeping schedule, days will just pass like it\u2019s nothing and I never know what time it is or what day it is. \n\nOne minute I\u2019ll be crying so hard I can barely breathe and the next I\u2019m just laying down staring at the wall feeling empty and just totally emotionless until I fall asleep. \n\nThis all sounds super edgy but that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening and it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, is this normal? Like I\u2019ve dealt with dissociating before I\u2019ve dealt with crying super hard but it\u2019s gotten so intense these past few days that I\u2019ve literally looked up HOW TO TELL IF UR LOSING YOUR SANITY at one point. Like lmao boy you\u2019re just depressed not insane relax.\n\nBut I really do feel like I\u2019m going insane sometimes.\n\nThis amount of isolation can\u2019t be good for anyone.\n\nDoes anyone else fantasize about laying next to someone else? I\u2019ll have entire conversations with a made up person in my head. Not a fleshed out person or anything, but more of just a human that\u2019s blurry, no exact features or voice or personality, but it\u2019s human shaped and that\u2019s enough. It can be whatever I need it to be. \n\nAlso just to clarify, I\u2019m not crazy and I don\u2019t have voices in my head or anything, I just mean in like an imaginary friend kind of way, except you\u2019re grown up now and your imaginary friend isn\u2019t a giant fluffy pink cat it\u2019s just a normal human who cares about you. Cause I guess those things are too hard to get now so you gotta imagine one up. Kinda weird how it goes from being like a crazy made up creature to oh I just need someone to hold my hand and wipe my tears away now. Pretty sad.\n\nWhen I\u2019m crying my eyes out I imagine they\u2019re holding me, and when I\u2019m feeling lonely I imagine they\u2019re holding my hand, and when I\u2019m walking to my bus stop I imagine they\u2019re walking next to me, and I talk in my head about the weather and imagine them answering, or my school work, and when I listen to my music playlist I pretend someone is in my seat next to me sharing my headphones (don\u2019t actually do that it\u2019s cute af but unsanitary af) and I\u2019m thinking do they like this song? Do they like me? Can I hold their hand? Can I kiss them? \n\nI wanna hold a boy\u2019s hand so bad like fuck why did they make boy\u2019s hands look like that.\n\nAnyways I\u2019m getting off track sorry I\u2019m just writing all of this after having a huge crying session and I just feel like getting all these thoughts out because if I don\u2019t do this now I might never honestly.\n\nAnd maybe someone else will relate to this, I don\u2019t know. \n\nI just have a lot of feelings that I have no way to express. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking tired.", "created_utc": "2019-12-17T00:36:14+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-17T00:36:16+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebo0fe/im_just_so_tired_a_vent_about_nothing_and/"}

The doctor was compassionate and I could tell he did care, but from this experience, I get the feeling that he's just there to diagnose and prescribe drugs, like as if I had a broken arm or some other straightforward physical ailment.\n\nHe diagnosed me with dysthymia and social anxiety. When I asked him how do we proceed from here at the end. One of the things he told me to try was to go meet people, like go to [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and find a meet up and don't worry about being uncomfortable.

I hate modern society. People say it\u2019s just a phase and that high school is different and people but get better. But I can tell they don\u2019t. The more I see, the more I realize that the world we live in is shallow, apathetic, and fake, built on terrible values and nearly zero morality. Those people out there who think they\u2019re so great because they help people usually only help a select group of people because it matters to them. The guys I see are shallow just like that. Stupid, fake, baseless emotions and an insufferable, innate nature to be \u201ccool.\u201d Not valuing other people\u2019s emotions and feelings. Not caring about making people happy. I don\u2019t know if girls are like that too, but all I can say is I hope not. Nowadays I go out of my way to avoid looking \u201cnormal,\u201d that is to say, to avoid looking like all those indifferent morons. I go out of my way to point my legs inwards to look unimposing and subdued. I intentionally shrink into myself around other people to stay as far out of their way as possible. I don\u2019t want to be associated with that terrible apathy. But obviously that does nothing. It doesn\u2019t make a difference how I act (not to anyone else and not to me). I wish people could see me for the caring, empathetic person I really am, and not just some quiet nobody. But then I have to ask myself- would anyone even care? Probably not. That\u2019s the crushing, depressing truth. The world is cold and selfish. I don\u2019t even hear those stories anymore, about a world where there is love and empathy, happiness and bonding. That\u2019s not reality. Not even in my dreams have I witnessed a world like that. Every day I just want to stop the pain, but I can\u2019t.

Well, really, I have no friends. None of them are caring or form true bonds with others. But then again - why should they? They have a family to do that with. I was born into this terrible world where I don\u2019t fit in. I\u2019m an enigma here - and that WILL NOT CHANGE. I\u2019m tired of people asking me to change MYSELF. I will not change my values and morals and beliefs and my identity just to be a part of this cold shell of a world. I don\u2019t know how I happened to come into this world- but I want out. My mind is woefully different. Nobody understands my mentality: help people be happy. Surround yourself with love. People ACT like they understand that. They THINK they understand that. But they don\u2019t. The truth is, they will only help others when there\u2019s something in it for them. They will only care if they\u2019re \u201cin the right mood\u201d or if they \u201cfeel like it.\u201d It sickens me. Please take me out of this world.

That all these feelings are just feelings and it's not as deadly as cancer. That all I have to do is as simple as thinking positively. She was dismissive, and completely downplayed everything I've opened up about. I could tolerate that maybe she does not care, but all she had to was to *believe* me. I wake up every single day with zero motivation, no zest and the desire to give up my dog to someone else then harm myself is strong.  \n\nI am extremely angry and frustrated at her until now. I accept that people have different opinions but all I ever wanted was them to not solve this crisis for me, but for them to just *listen.* They've asked me a few times about this and come the time I told them, I was met with, not an extreme reaction but an unwelcoming response, nonetheless. I wish I could just describe what I think and feel every single day into words but it's tedious. The only reason why I do not open up to my friends and family about this is I do not want to put a damper on anyone else's day.

(apologies for the long read)", "author": "melancholicflowers", "selftext": "I don\u2019t expect you to read all of this, but if you do, thanks I guess. A few years ago I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and insomnia. I am now also diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and PTSD. \n\nMy childhood is as pretty normal. My dad worked and my mom was a stay at home mom. We also had food and toys, and my parents never abused me and brother. \n\nWhen I was 14 I met this girl and fell in love with her. From 15-18 we dated off and on. I should clarify at this moment that I myself am female and dating her shook up my entire world. It caused a lot of inter personal conflicts as I was raised Baptist. She was so sweet and caring in the beginning but over time she started drinking and doing hard drugs. She became very verbally and emotionally abusive. When all of this was happening, I hadn\u2019t came out to anyone out of fear because I had seen how friends close to me had been treated by their parents and the community for who they were. So while this was happening, I didn\u2019t tell anyone and just tried to suppress it. \n\nWhile all of this was happening, my dad was having an affair. He was moving in and out to live  with his girlfriend (a very abusive woman in many ways) or my mother. My mother refused to leave him based on her religion (that you shouldn\u2019t get a divorce and God will fix everything if you pray hard enough). On multiple occasions my father told me the reason he was leaving my family was because of me. He told me I caused him too much stress (I had a suicide attempt that sent me to the hospital when I was 16) and that I was too much like my mother for him to like me. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m 18. My girlfriend leaves me for another girl who she does heroin with (we cut any and all contact) and I\u2019m lost. I move out and into college. A few months after starting school, she calls me and tells me she tried to kill herself. She didn\u2019t know what to do and I talked to her for a few days to calm her down and make sure she got proper hospital care. Then she left again. Flash forward about 2 months, she calls me again. She said she broke up with her girlfriend and she loves me. She made so many promises she had changed and she was getting off hard drugs and she would work on our relationship like she should have from the beginning. It was all things I had heard before, but this time I actually believed her. Flash forward 3 more weeks. She tells me just being around me makes her feel immense amounts of guilt. She tells me that she notices the slight personally differences, the slight ways I talk, the slight ways I present myself, the slight changes in me that resulted from years of abuse. She tells me that seeing that made her want to kill herself over what she did and she was never going to talk to me again. Again, I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken. I\u2019m angry at her, I\u2019m angry at myself for believing her. \n\nTwo weeks later she sends me a letter (I had blocked her on every form of media). She told me she loves me and there was stuff she wanted to say, but it would have to wait until another time. She sent me some small personal stuff (including a necklace she got me for Valentine\u2019s Day). I was even more angry that she was trying to do this to me all over again. So, I emailed her. I told her that she didn\u2019t just get to come and go in my life like that like she pleased. I told her this was it, this was the end, that she was to never contact me again.

I think I expected her to come back into my life and for us to be happy. \n\nA week later someone contacted me. She had committed suicide. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few months now, but I still feel as though it happened yesterday. I miss her like crazy and I don\u2019t know what to do. Honestly, it\u2019s been over a year since she left me for the other girl so I feel as though I should be much further past it. I feel like I\u2019m overreacting about everything that\u2019s happening. I feel like it\u2019s hard too hard to get out of bed most days and I can\u2019t concentrate on anything. I know people who go through so much more and I feel so guilty for being sad. Everyone seems to have moved on and I seem to be trapped. Multiple friends of mine have told me I need to be over it by now and I shouldn\u2019t have been sad to begin with. I had a happy childhood, and I do well in school, I have a job. My family tells me theres nothing to be sad about and maybe I just believe them a bit. So many more people go through greater things and here I am making myself sad over something that happened a long time ago. \n\nAnyway, thank you for the read.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T23:32:43+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T23:32:44+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebn6oq/i_feel_as_if_im_overreacting_apologies_for_the/"}

I am sorry if it comes off as simply venting. And if you read the whole thing... well... thanks I guess.\n\n__________________\n\nI am a 35-year-old male in the Washington DC area who has spent most of his life dealing with depression. I tend to think it started at the end of elementary school when I began to be bullied by a new student. The bullying continued through middle and early high school but with different characters. I spent most of my school years hiding within a shell, putting on a mask to hide who I really was on a daily basis and simply trying to move forward. I had friends, but not many. I had goals, but vague ones. I was an introverted and shy individual who could still be a social butterfly if just put in the right situation with folks I was comfortable with. I flailed about towards the end of my teen years and then eventually bailed on college to start working.\n\nFast forward about 10 years. After 10 years of dead-end jobs (well only 3 total in that time), I decided it was time for a change. Enough was enough. I give all credit to this change to both my rediscovery of my creative side (beginning to paint and draw) and to my parents who took me back in to help me save and gave me the gift of classes at a community college. I began creating art again, which I had loved as a child but had left behind for some reason. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with an Associates' degree in Fine Arts in 2 years. I was dating a classmate who I loved and who loved me back. I was getting my life together. I got a job in marketing making decent money and began attending school at a traditional college to get a Bachelor's degree and getting straight A's. In my free time, I continued painting and drawing and was showing work at local restaurants and selling online.\n\nMy life was finally looking up, and my struggles with depression and motivation seemed to be behind me. I was just a \"slow-bloomer\" folks would say. I would nod politely but in private think that it was likely just art and creativity providing me an outlet to keep the depression at bay. A therapy of sorts.\n\n_____________\n\nThen within the span of a few years, it all went to shit. \n\nMy girlfriend broke it off. Not because she really wanted to but because her parents did not approve of me as a match for their daughter. They wanted someone of a similar cultural and religious background, and someone who was closer in age (we were 8 years apart) and that was not me. She respected them too much and could not choose between me and her family. I don't hate her for it but it hurt me.\n\nI lost my marketing job. To be fair, I basically quit due to concerns about both the health of the company and in protest with other employees over the way they were treating women. My reasoning for quitting was proven right in the long term with the company having issues, and the local office being closed within a year. I also had been having health issues. But then I struggled to find another job before finally just picking up a retail position for the time being.\n\nAnd then, as if to kick me when I was down, I was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Stage IV. Non-curable. I had been feeling bad for several years, and it probably did not help with other elements of my life. After the diagnosis, I was forced to quit my job and put school on hold while undergoing emergency treatments to stabilize my situation. I then became classified as disabled due to the side effects of both the tumors and treatments. Consistent fatigue, nausea, and other less pleasant elements complicate my life.  I have managed to continue school when I can, but the hope of graduating in 2 years, has now turned into a 4-year slog with several more to go due to limitations and needing time off for surgeries.\n\nSo here I am, a long-term cancer patient without hope of a cure. No job and even if I find one I would be limited in what I could do and how much I could work. No girlfriend with the prospects of finding one being quite bleak, despite my best efforts to put on a brave face and put myself out there on dating apps and occasionally out in the world. I mean, who wants to date a cancer patient with no end in sight? Who wants to take a shot on someone who has restrictions and health concerns. And of course... school dragging on.\n\nI am stuck. Stuck in an endless loop of surgeries, treatments, and self-pity. I have such little motivation to go out and do anything, and complicating it all is the consistent fatigue I feel. I am constantly lonely and longing for a significant other. I have almost no close friends left, in part because I am so introverted, and my previous ones have busy lives or have moved on. I live with my parents because of my situation and while I love them to death, the idea of it embarrasses and frustrates me. I can't even find the motivation to paint or draw or write or do any of the creative endeavors that had brought me out of the darkness the first time around. When not in a class, I simply watch TV, play a video game, or read a book. Looking for an easy mental stimulation and a minimal effort mental escape where I can forget myself.\n\nI sit here, hoping some wonderful woman will think I am interesting, decide to give me a shot and kick my ass into gear and make me want to be a better person for them. Or perhaps some art patron will see my work, love it, share it with the world, and make me excited to explore new things. But until then, I just sink further into quicksand, because I simply can't motivate myself to do anything!\n\nI got out of a spiral once before, but this one feels much worse in large part due to the nature of an incurable cancer that may very well shorten my life. I feel angry at the cancer for not just killing me if it was not going to be curable. I feel angry at myself for feeling that way when others with cancer would give ANYTHING to have more time with their loved ones. And of course tremendous guilt as well.\n\nI am a good, sweet, shy person with a good heart. I am a Hufflepuff. I am not terrible looking. I am not suicidal (although I have been feeling as if I may be creeping closer). But I am introverted and seemingly lacking the ability to motivate myself these days. I can work hard with the right motivation. I have potential.\n\nBut I am stuck. I AM STUCK. WHY CAN'T I MOTIVATE MYSELF!\n\n________________________________________\n\nEvery day I put on my mask. \n\nI smile. I laugh. I talk. I cry. I play.\n\nEvery day that mask wears thin and begins to crack.\n\nI hunger to escape and wish to remain hidden.\n\nCan I be both open and closed without crumbling to dust?\n\nIt's a new day.\n\nTime to start all over again.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T23:24:21+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T23:24:24+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebn2ui/motivation_is_becoming_a_real_problem/"}

I thought it would be the perfect thing to cheer me up despite the fact I couldn't quite afford to do much on the trip.

My cousin forgets that not everybody can walk long distances like he can so we had to walk the whole way to the hotel in pouring rain because of his stubbornness. The hotel was too hot, the AC didnt work and the windows only opened 6 inches. Times square and the areas surrounding it are absolutely trash. Every inch of that part of the city has some freak trying to steal your money. If not that, every single thing in that area is designed to cost everyone money. Nothing that goes on in that place is for the betterment of humanity. It's all specifically to make some Corporations money one way or another. I couldn't enjoy much because there were dangerously thick crowds on every inch of the city. Rockefeller center with the ice rink and tree was even worse because you couldn't stand in one spot for more than a second without getting shoved into by some dipshit. I missed a public marriage proposal that happened a few feet away, which witnessing one of those in person is one of the few things on my bucket list so that stung a lot.

{"id": "ebmxl6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ebmxl6/how_i_fight_it_and_how_im_winning/", "title": "How I fight it, and how I'm winning.", "author": "a-soldier", "selftext": "First of all, I'll try my best to be clear altough 1st, english is not my main language; 2nd I'm not a person who has the ambition to help others trough this, I'll be doing it as an exercise and if by chance this actually reaches and relates to someone then that is great. This is more of a way to organize my thoughts and perhaps seek further advice.\n\nWith that out of the way, I wish to share with you my thoughts and experience with depression and what I find useful and what I don't, this may and does change from person to person.\n\nWe won't be going trough my life and my issues we are headed for the solution, but I guess there should be a summary of how I got to know more about this topic.\n\nMy first relation with depression came at a young age, with my mother. She had me really young and not really accomplished, and had severe depression. She did prevail and achieved many great things later in life, I can't complain about growing up, I did have an overall good childhood, may not have been a happy one but that was not anyone's fault but mine, I was a troublesome kid that was very alone, obviously I did not know better too at the time at that is the first thing I wan't to point out, and it may be as well the most important one for it's the starting point.\n\nSome people live in guilt during their whole existance, this is the first thing we must fight off otherwise it stops us right there, at the first floor. How do I do it? When you first recognize that you did not have **it** in you, it starts to slow you down less trough time and I mean, it takes time, and effort. It's trough realization that you were weak and had to come all this way to learn about your weakness you realize that above all else, you are in your place, exactly where you should be because you are that person, the way we deal with things do in most cases determine our future status.\n\nDone with that? Not quite I bet, but it gets better. Before I was way older I did not understand depression or recognized it as a real, because you can't spot it, it doesn't get you sick and vomiting or with fever, doesn't hurt or heal like a broken bone, this led me back then to believing that it was just a drama fueled failure in our way of thinking, that things were not clear and you yourself was causing it, well sometimes it could be like that and it certanly can be, but it's not only that. Part of it comes from weakness, human weakness, I have it, you have it.\n\nDepression is not weakness, it is weakness that lead you to it. For example if a loved one dies and you were not around them as much as you think you should, you did not treat them as you think you should or simply did not enjoy your time with them as you should've. You get swallowed by the feeling of depression, you will feel ungrateful, angry, sad, you will succumb to your guilty thoughts and at that point, what you failed to realize is that no matter what, to continue we just have to deal with, some do it better than others no doubt but it is part of everyone's life and SO is depression.\n\nTake envy as an example, you have to deal with it, everyone does at some point in time. For me it works in two ways, you either felt it in the past and realized it, fought against it and slowly turned it in some other thing, using it as inspiration, ambition (WAY healthier) or by just simply shutting it down and silencing it. Or you are still in that process, you feel angry, ungrateful, and you are going crazy about other people's realizations when in reality, you are just slowing yourself down. Also, the longer you take to fight it the more of a habit it becomes and harder it is to realize what you should be doing instead, the brain is a muscle, it demands maintenance, working it out. Depression is no different here, if you want to move forward you WILL have to fucking chew it and fight it.\n\nWork your brain, stop doing whatever makes you weak, or distracted from the struggle, face it. Go out there, because in here is the same old misery we are so used to, guess what, there is nothing new here, only out there, you will need to accept this or otherwise it means giving up. What do you have to lose? Do whatever you have to do, I did not take any depression meds, you really think thats your way out of it? You do you, but remember, you will have to substitute it with a healthier solution, just like we did with envy earlier. Why? Because you will be dependent of what you use to fight it, even if it is completely healthy. My best bet would be exercising, if you are in that state of mind at least when working out you can say to yourself I'm fighting it, that alone makes me more noble and worthy, not to mention the chemical help your body will produce. Not into that? Are you social? Not? Be more social. Stay close to people, share with someone, it's not easy with help imagine alone. If you don't have anybody, well that's what this place is for right? Remember, all of it comes with struggle. Remember to embrace it, you don't have any other choice.\n\nDon't go hard on yourself (you really shouldn't), or do, but don't go soft on yourself, never. That is exactly what brought you here, remember that you did not have it in you, what is done is done. Now it is time to stand up for yourself and fight against it, and with action.\n\nI've been excelent for long periods of time now, I did have ups and downs but everytime it happens the climb looks shorter. You will develop a method. Mine is to keep my mind busy, to face the issue and never run from it. These past days I had another major tough break but in record time I goddamn dealt with it, for a long time it felt like something impossible and this is way I wanted to throw it on paper, just so I remember I can win this, and so can everyone else.\n\nPeace guys and be welcome to share whatever you think about the subject, ask for specific help or criticise. It sure did me hella good telling you this, whoever you are.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T23:13:35+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T23:13:36+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebmxl6/how_i_fight_it_and_how_im_winning/"}

Not constantly, more like every now and then, getting more and more. No one knows this about me, because I'm too scared to talk to my family and friends and the one person I talked to about not feeling happy, told me this might be a \"quarter-life-crisis\" and to take some Iron pill to pump up my motivation. I don't think my parents would mock me or something, but I'm scared they're gonna say: \"It's just a phase\" or \"Everybody feels sad sometimes\". They are experts in making my problems seem less important than their own.\n\nIt is generally very hard for me to communicate with anybody about my feelings. I had a really great Ex-Boyfriend (1 year ago) but every time he asked me if I wanted to go out or \"out\" myself with him in public, I made up excuses and I just couldn't be myself around him. Which is weird, because I actually felt kind of comfortable. \n\nThe sadness has resulted in me punching a wall, injuring my hand permanently ,on multiple times. This summer, I actually cut myself with the pieces of a broken glass bottle twice. Told my \"friends\" I had fallen into some glass shards and been attacked by a cat. Nobody seemed to care, they didn't ask any further questions. I don't think I did this to get attention, because I try to hide wounds/scars/bruises so that I don't get asked any questions. \n\nI also drink a lot. Beer, Vodka, Gin anything with a high percentage, almost every night. I know that alcohol is a natural depressant, so I can't actually tell how much of what I'm feeling is actually just the alcohol. I'm generally a very sensitive person, I cry at everything. Nobody knows this about me. Around my family and friends I'm known as the funny, confident, weird person who get's angry quickly, but I think the fact that I'm confident (on the outside) and that I would and have put my life on hold, to help them is why they keep me around. Even though I might seem confident on the outside, I don't feel like that on the inside at all. It takes my at least 10mins to make a phone call, because I have to rehearse everything I want to say multiple times. Meeting new people is super exhausting but after 2/3 beers I'm ready to talk to anyone. \n\nI sleep a lot, when I can. Mostly I lie awake at night, thinking about everything and why I'm sad and how to get rid of it. \n\nI know I should talk to a therapist. I've had 3 appointments. I didn't go to a single one, because I couldn't make myself and at my Uni it's free. I always feel stressed. Even though my life is not always stressful. For days on end I don't go to Uni, I eat a lot, I drink during the day. I don't know how to stop myself. \n\nI think the only thing keeping my afloat at the moment is my dog. She's the sweetest. A lot of work, because she needs her exercise, but that's good for me, because she forces me to go outside. \n\nHonestly I don't even know who I am. Last week I told a person I have lived in Hungary for a short time, because I accidentally said I've lived in 3 instead of 2 countries and I felt so embarrassed that I couldn't take it back. \n\nSo I think that's it.

It happens many times that when i'm out with them, i just instantly become sad and quit the conversation. Tried to make some friends at uni but they don't want me in their group, and i'm too shy to just sit and talk to someone.\n\nI play football but always benching bc I'm a goalkeeper, not too bad technically (they say) but i'm 5' 6\" (1.70m) and not a single coach ever trusts me. I'm su unmotivated but they keep forcing me to stay in that club and I feel too bad to just leave when the transfer market is closed.\n\nMy mom is constanlty insulting me and screaming that i have no friend, no gf, underperforming at uni and football, and i'm gonna die alone if I continue like this.

No passions, no hobbies, nothing to do at home, no friends, nowhere to go... i just feel lost.

why didn't even considering what i feel mom? i was bullied then getting home, this is what all am i gonna receive? most of the time, i used to think that she don't love me. she doesn't. she didn't care for me. she just knew being superior about being a mom, being a parent literally. cuz it is only about the fact that she is along with my dad who's sending me to school to study. they were used to provide my needs and wants regards allowance, food, clothes even a house to settle in. how ironic right?\n\nbeing reminded with that relation to my parents makes me don't want to idolize them anymore. it makes me lose my respect and forgotten my love for them. as i grew up i slowly build walls for them to be in distant. cuz i don't trust em eversince i turned seeing reality differently. it's no fun and easy to get along with your dreams and hopes. \n\ni have a brother yes. but he is not always around. he loves being out of home. spending time with his barkadas, smoking and being in the court game. he used to woke up early than me and getting home late around 11 pm or half past midnight. some of the times, it extended to 1 or 3 am. we weren't close to each other. all i knew that he hates me for not knowing the reasons at all. and it hurts. \n\nyes i lived in a complete family but feels like i am not. it was shallowed and they we're narrowed. it feels like not a home with them. bc we didn't talk about life, about how we feel regards to our life outside. they only used to judge and refuse to pay attention and listen. \n\nand i am friendless. ever since i was a little i didn't had the chance to feel like a normal kid who have lots of friends to come over and be with. i do have but it's shallow. it feels like i am only being with them to feel belong and not so alone. \n\nuntil i get in the middle school. still no friends. i became feel awkward of being me cuz still no one likes me for what and who i am. i play guitar, i sing, i dance, i draw, i write; poetry, i love acting. some say that i am smart and kind. i excel in terms of academic performances. i care for other's feelings than they should too. that's who i am and still no one likes me. \n\nas i grew up, i see lots of teens who obviously love being friends with the one who has the popularity. who are receiving hundreds of likes with every picture that that person post. the one who has the looks, the wealth and the one who has the power. when you are involve into a fight, gang fight you are loved. you are praised esp when there's something on you that makes them think to go favor on you as if that is what having a great friends to be. when you have this and those you are loved. \n\ni accepted those reality of the world. the world i have being with my classmates and family. \n\ni became introvert. avoiding myself with the negativity of life. trying to be positive all alone in silent. but know what's worse? they still have the guts to say &amp; throw shits about you. even how remain silent you are and not allowing yourself to get in their lives thinking you will just fuck it and mess it. so you chose to be isolated. \n\ni became introvert cuz everyone don't want me obviously. they don't want me on my highest and bestest. they could've congratulate me yet they chose to not. anyone of you might think they're just jealous but i think they are not. there's nothing about me to be jealous of. i am just a loser and a failure as everyone think. how could they even feel envy about me? even on my lowest and shady pace being alive, they don't stop. they still haunting me. watching me falling apart, breaking and making me lose all i've got.\n\nand yes i am here again at this point of my life losing interest in studying. because my classmates made me do so... my parents were mad at me bc of opening about my thesis issue. blaming me again that it is my fault. instead of comforting and supporting me at this lowest. \n\n\"tapusin mo nalang. wag kana mag-aral kung ganyan lang din. magtrabaho ka nalang.\"\n\n\n\ni don't want to live longer for i reminisce those nightmares and reminding only myself as a loser, a failure.\n\n\ni want to end this here. i'm giving up to graduate next year. i'm not gonna make it. i'm giving up to review for PUPCET for my dream course. i was happy knowing alr what im gonna take but i'll pass. i'm giving up my passion regards music. i was planning to go for another gig but everything has paid with madness, despair and losing. \n\n\n\ni'm sorry.\n\ni love you mama, papa and kuya.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T21:29:15+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T21:29:21+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eblhi6/10_1619_an_open_letter_for_i_thought_this_time_my/"}

Women expressing how good their experience with a big (not monstrous) dick was.\n* I go to big dick forums and I find happiness everywhere and success stories, I go to a smal dick forum and I find suicide fuel.\n* I tried to go for \"gone wild\" groups of the city where I live, on reddit and all the stories are just about men showing off their big dicks or videos/images with big ones and girls enjoying them, the only image I found where a guy (which might have taken him some courage) posted a small dick picture, he was mocked in comments.\n* Whenever there are threads about what is the smallest dick you have seen? Women explain their encounters with guys like me and most of them don't go well and then people even make fun of us... I just want you to know. I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY NOT INTEND TO HURT, OR MAY BE YOU CAN'T RELATE OR UNDERSTAND WHY IT SHOULD, BUT IT HURTS SO BAD!!! it just makes me feel like I should've stayed the way I was, it.. I dunnoo... it sucks to hear that, no matter if it's the reality, it f##ing hurts.\n* I talk to a redditor regularly who helps me get rid of my suicidal thoughts, and few days ago we were discussing things that turn me on (since I haven't explored my kinks, of course and I know less about what things that happen in real world and what stays just in porn world)...... So , yeah, turns out am into \"role-reversal\" or \"gentle femdom\" or similar thing (without the slave or pet thing, just caring/loving and teasing and all) but I live at a place where people know nothing about sex coz sex is almost never discussed. So how am I supposed to try those thing out if I ever manage to get over my insecurities? I won't be able to find a partner who is into those things (That's the reason I explored the gone wild groups).\n* (My entire post history is on this topic so, please don't debate over this here ). After all this, I am the butt of joke everywhere , there are songs ridiculing my body, there are advertisements and many bad traits or behaviour are linked to \"small penis\", just to make the guy who did that feel bad. But my question is: DOES THE SOCIETY EVER THINK ABOUT ME? You used small penis to shame a guy who did something terrible.. so well, do they once, just once think about guys who have it , before saying that? Rather it is always defended by some cause like \"it is to stop rash driving\", \"because president did bad things\", \"because pop culture was shaming women\"... but what's my fault in that? We didn't do anything wrong :'( why is small dick being used to shame them? and they know what their size is so that insult did nothing but shamed us/me coz it is a symbol of shame as used in those ads/songs/situations. So that makes me extremely sad and insecure.\n\nI want to see that happy/amazed look on my partner's face as well, I want to satisfy them or make them orgasm multiple times even if I don't, I want them to want me the way I read the wanting guys with big organs, I want them to feel the lust for me as well. But I have a small organ and I can't help it. I wanted to do those \"wild things\" as well. I've never tried and talked to a woman, but after all that I've seen and I see everyday, How am I supposed to even try? specially when I want to explore sex first rather than going for a relationship (which I sure want to in near future coz, like I said, i need to feel \"love\" may be, it's something I've never felt but surely sound great).\n\nSo, yeah! What should i do?\n\nA Request: I know it's mostly jokes, it's not meant that way, people have a sense of humour for it. But please before dick shaming someone or cracking a small dick joke, please do consider this, that he might have all these things in his brain as well, he might get deeply hurt and still smile in front of you. He might be so insecure, sad and frustrated (frustrated of the last point) that he needs therapy. So, yeah it... sucks to know that the feeling that people talk about all the time, the thing that majority of humans crave the most apparently, is something I won't be able to experience the same way, and on top of that there are enough things to convince me that society sees it as something shameful to have.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T20:02:27+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T20:02:32+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebkamz/im_sorry_but_what_am_i_supposed_to_do/"}

The one cousin of mine who isn't a doctor or nurse is some rich millionaire banker. The majority of my aunts and uncles are doctors or nurses too... and then there's me. I'm a bunch of wasted potential and the worst part is, most of my family don't even realize that. I've always been very vocal about not wanting to have any sort of medical profession. Some of my uncles and aunts make me out to be this genius writer to overcompensate for that when I never fucking wanted that. They literally keep on bringing up poems I wrote in MIDDLE SCHOOL in which I used the thesaurus thing on Microsoft to use big words as evidence that I'm some great writer. I literally always fucking tell them not to be impressed I used big words when I just used that thesaurus Microsoft feature, but they don't get it. If I'm not exceptional at something, I'm nothing to them. I used to have a passion for writing, until I turned 15. That's when I think my depression started. I was officially diagnosed with depression at age 17 and I'm 20 now. I was never studious or hard working since high school started, and they don't know that. I didn't have all As and Bs, I barely passed. I have no passion for anything and only went along with getting an English major because I thought I'm naturally good at it, but I'm not. I'm still in community college and just now decided to change my major to become a therapist which is funny because I'm the one who needs therapy. I was somewhat content living this dead-end lifestyle of taking only two classes a semester at community college even though how behind in life I am compared to my same age to barely older cousins scared the shit out of me, until my dad commit suicide a few months ago. Suddenly, I had all this extra pressure on me. All my life I avoided my family because I didn't like how fake and strict they are and I don't know I've always just been asocial and my cousins didn't like me so I just didn't go. I avoided two uncles of mine and their families for two straight years because of how they treated me after I was raped until my dad killed himself and that was the first time I saw them again. Because they would always be at major family functions that I would avoid I barely saw my entire family until he killed himself. I still haven't forgiven them for what they have done and I hate that I have to smile and pretend like things are okay with them. Being around them has just made me more depressed because they all look down on me and blame me for my dad's suicide which is understandable but I won't get into that right now. Throughout high school I didn't bother to try because I thought I have no future and that I would kill myself by 18 anyway. Well I'm too cowardly to kill myself because I'm afraid of the physical pain and surviving the attempt. Where I live, you have to be 21 to get a gun and you can't get a gun if you have been forcibly institutionalized so I don't want to try now, fail, and then be unable to end my life the easy way: shooting myself in the head. It takes so much out of me to do one thing. I have so many horrific problems outside of my father's suicide before and after his death. I never learned to drive or had a real job and then he killed himself and the family including my mother and brother blame me (it's a long story). I have my permit now and have been getting driving lessons with my uncle and I was so proud of that. But then my mom broke down about me not having a job and about how I'll become homeless or dependent on family members that despise me and think I'm trash for being an atheist with a boyfriend among other things. I was feeling like I was finally improving but now I think there's no point anyway because I'll always be lazy, miserable useless worthless trash. I applied for two jobs I didn't get and I'll apply for more but it's so hard when I've been a depressed, lonely useless loser for so long. I need to drive so I can take my brother to school so my mom can work full time again. She thinks my brother who's 16 is too good for the bus so she got a part time job that's not enough to pay our bills just so she can drive him to school in the morning. She screamed at me when I suggested he just take the bus saying that's what homeless beggars do. So now we're going to financially struggle and it's all my fault because I had a stupid phobia of driving for so long and my dad always did it until he couldn't because he's dead. There's so much wrong with my life and most of it is my fault. I need therapy but I can't ask my mom because whenever I ask her for anything she talks about how it's my fault my dad killed himself and it's my fault we're struggling and that I'm going to end up dependent on family who think I'm trash and that there's no way she's going to do anything for me. Whenever she is remotely upset about anything, she somehow makes it about how I basically murdered my dad who commit suicide. I feel like I was born to fail. My dad was depressed and psychotic and attempted suicide when I was 10. He felt useless for being unable to get a well paying job and for the past 10 years he was mostly unemployed except for Lyft driving in the last year before he killed himself. I was just set up for failure. The rest of my cousins had stable parents and here I am, the black sheep. I hate how everyone makes the stupidest reasons for why I am the way I am, too. They blame it on me not being religious or whatever when I know it's not true and it just adds to my endless stress.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T19:45:50+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T19:45:51+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebk2c7/im_the_least_successful_person_in_my_family_and_i/"}

But, probably, because of it I'm affraid to tell my opinion or feelings to others. About 1-2 years ago was I lucky to get into group of friends who were really nice to me like no one else in my life have ever been, but my \"condition\" started to kick in and take much bigger and bigger tool on me and my insanity until the point where I had to really deal with my anger issues, but it was too late because those friends wanted me out of their lifes. Probably because it was becoming a toxic relationship and I completely agree with and take the blame for it. But the guilt still doesn't erase the sadness of losing someone like that. Now, since then I got up on my feet and found new people in my life. And, as every \"stupid\" (reffering to only me) teenager, I started to like someone. This where the problem starts: due to me wanting to learn from my past mistakes I'm affraid to even feel something like that to other person because I know I will f*** it up somehow and even if I'm succesful to get close to that person, I got close before - and I f***** it up. Just seem to can't find the middle ground maybe and it really makes it unfortuned/sad.\n\nSorry, if my thoughts are a bit rocky and thank You for those who took time to read it!", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T19:34:51+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T19:34:52+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebjwwy/i_really_dont_know_what_im_doing/"}

I mean, I was like that before. I liked talking to people, its the only escape I have, but I annoy people. I never agree, mostly because my ideology. I\u2019m just too pessimistic. I wish I wasn\u2019t, but if I lost my pessimism I\u2019d have nothing left.

I want to find an answer! One of the best things I can do is map out the strange, the things people never could wrap their heads around. I wanted to start a blog about it, but it would be lost in the noise. If I could get a foothold on love, I could let everyone else in. But I can\u2019t. I\u2019m beginning to doubt that I have the mental fortitude for it. I hate being sacred. I just need to hookup. That\u2019s the entrance into the rabbit hole. But I don\u2019t know if I can. I wish I could, I wish someone would help me, someone nice. I don\u2019t think nice and hookup often go together. I hate being told to wait, I hate being told I\u2019m too young. Guys my age are the wheels of hookups, without them those stupid apps would never see the light of day. I\u2019m just not one of them. I can never catch their eye. I tore myself down so I can build back up, but now I just keep resetting. I opened a door I can never close. All I want to do is talk, but I\u2019m even bad at that. If I could find someone I could talk to, I\u2019d be happy. Maybe that\u2019s my type, talking. Dammit I just want to change. I\u2019m leave my town, my state, spending half a year on the other side of the country. I\u2019m leaving my small town, breaking my curse. Right? No, it\u2019s my curse, it\u2019s who I am. No pills can change that, no CBT. I want answers, real answers. I can find just about anything that\u2019s out there. It\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. But love? Sex? Romance? These are the most popular subjects in the world, but I can\u2019t even find scraps. I\u2019m starving, I\u2019m insane. I don\u2019t care what I look like anymore, I just don\u2019t want to be desperate again. I\u2019m back on my medication, I\u2019m losing the weight, I thought I had friends.

Drunken pitty sex on a night out that took me months to plan. I don\u2019t even remember how it felt, it lasted less than a minute. That\u2019s why I need a hookup, so I can find that rabbit hole again. I just need to stop, I need to give up. Never give up. Give it up. Your too hard on yourself. You need to push harder. Why can\u2019t anyone answer my questions? Have they lost all meaning? Are they just a Rosetta Stone of gibberish and self-destruction? I don\u2019t need to talk to my family, they never help.

I stopped going to my therapist of 3 years a few months ago. I had created habits that I felt could help me through the bad times I knew I would face again because my depression is one of the few constants in my life. I felt like I no longer had anything to gain from therapy. I\u2019m going through a bout with it now and it has my confidence shaken. Before I felt like \u201cI am just one of those people who has a chemical imbalance in some way. It\u2019s completely normal and I have the tools to overcome it\u201d. Now I feel like I didn\u2019t do enough work to heal and overcome past traumas in therapy and I feel as though that fear has me reliving the past. Maybe the fact that I\u2019m reliving the past at all is indeed indicative of the fact that I haven\u2019t overcome things that I thought I had. Is my mind playing tricks on me?? I\u2019m starting to get very paranoid about the realness of life also. I experience dissociation brought on by PTSD. I can\u2019t connect with my memories.

Thank you for reading. \n\nSo I haven't dated or had sex in a few years now because I have the urge to eat women and I don't want to act on it. What started out as a casual interest in serial killer documentaries has morphed into an unhealthy desire to copy the things that cannibalistic serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish did. I'm no stranger to healthy relationships either - I've dated some wonderful ladies, with each relationship lasting multiple months/years. It was a privilege to learn and grow with all of these women, none of them were ever abusive or cruel towards me, and I always strived to be an absolute gentleman towards them :). \n\nI think something is psychologically wrong with me though. I grew up with a mom who constantly called me ugly, stupid, worthless, and every other insult under the sun, who would throw things at me and tell me these things since I was a toddler. She would dump my toys out all over the floor and scream at me to pick them up, telling me I was a piece of crap that should get out of her face, she'd say she never wanted to see me again and that she was going to kill herself (she never did), etc. She ended up running a meth den in our house, dealing drugs, stealing, and working as a prostitute. The point I'm trying to make is that I wonder if these childhood experiences have shaped my subconscious outlook towards women. I'm in my early 20s now, and apparently the average serial killer begins harming people around age 28. I DO NOT want to end up doing that. Life is precious, and I care about people too much to follow through with my urges. I just worry that I won't be able to control myself in the future.\n\nLastly, I really want to go to therapy, but I'm afraid that I'll get involuntarily hospitalized, which I can't financially afford at all. I just dont know what to do and I'm hoping maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice. It doesn't even have to be cannibal related, you could be a pyromaniac or a kleptomaniac or something. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.

Feel trapped.", "author": "Mango_tea19", "selftext": "So.. This is a bit of a vent post because I just really have no idea what to do and it might help to have some outside opinions.\n\nBackstory: I'm 19 and have really bad anxiety &amp; depression. I was a dog walker from age 11-18 but had never had my own dog. I was going to college in the fall and after completely freaking out about it, I decided to look into getting a dog. In January I adopted a 2 year old chocolate lab/pitbull mix from the humane society and she was perfect except for some occasional outbursts. She was good on walks, she chilled in my room while I was doing homework and was generally nice to take care of. But about 2 weeks after I got her she out of nowhere bit me in the face and I had to get several stitches. We called to make an appointment at the humane society to put her back up for adoption but they didn't tell us until we got there that they were going to put her down.\n\nMy depression got much much worse and I pretty much didn't get out of bed for a month. I was kind of manic and I realize now that this was a bad decision and tbh I can't believe my parents agreed, but I decided to get a goldendoodle puppy. The plan was to take a gap year to train him before going to go to college. \n\nI didn't realize until after I already had the puppy that taking a gap year would affect my financial aid so I couldn't do that after all. My mom agreed to take care of the puppy (Lucas) while I was at school. I still paid for all of his things and I have to come home during school breaks to give my mom a break.\n\nThe thing is, I learned a lot of things about myself during my first semester and I just... Don't think I make a very good dog owner. Because of the dog walking/housesitting I thought I somewhat knew what I was getting myself into but it's more different than I possibly could've imagined. The reason I got a dog in the first place is for emotional support and cuddles. Lucas doesn't even like being pet and hasn't cuddled since he was a puppy. He's always been very nippy and he's almost a year old now and still hasn't grown out of it. When he was a puppy we did EXTENSIVE training but we still can't even take him on walks because he jumps and bites us when he gets bored. Everything is so draining and I'm just having such a hard time right now. I feel like I've dug myself into a hole that I'll never get out of. And the thing is I LOVE Lucas so much!! I want the best for him. But I can't have him at college because he barks when anyone in the building moves around.\n\nI feel like I can't do this anymore. I have no choice but to be home during the breaks but it's awful for me and my mental health. Me and my mom fight CONSTANTLY and I just feel so awful and worthless when I'm here. Any time I try to talk to my mom about how I'm feeling she takes it as an insult to herself and starts yelling at me. I can't take it anymore, I need to get out of here.

I've been in a downward spiral for the last two or three years, and my behavior is causing me to isolate myself and hurt those who have tried the hardest to help me. \n\nI've never maintained close relationships, but a couple of old coworkers have always continued to go out of their way to treat me like family and make an effort to stay in touch with me and invite me to events. I feel terrible because I contribute nothing to the friendship they are trying to foster; I can't see the upside to life any more. The last year has consisted of losing family members to cancer, suffering from an injury resulting in chronic pain, and being laid off from my job. My boyfriend proposed to me this year, but the stress and expectations from family for a ceremony has even sucked the joy out of that.\n\nHere's my problem: This weekend my coworker invited me to a housewarming party at her new home. I was genuinely happy for her and her husband, and I love them dearly, but when we got to their house I felt my social anxiety kicking in and it was almost impossible for me to emote or make any sort of positive conversation. I came off like a complete asshole and I couldn't think of anything to say. The person who I consider closest to me drove hours to come to this party and made every effort to start and keep the conversation going, and again, I just shut down. I couldn't think of anything to talk about, I had nothing positive to say, and I could see their body language change and them recede from me through the remainder of the night. I don't blame this person at all- I would have been offended and hurt by my behavior and seeming lack of interest, too. I just can't believe that I shut down around the same person I could always speak to with no reservation through email, who has always been there to support me and who I consider closer than any family member. I blew it. \n\nI'm aware enough to realize that I've been phasing out personal relationships and isolating myself because I feel like a burden. But when I got together with the people who have worked the hardest to help me along the way the last few years, I just went right back into the cycle of sabotaging any chance of fostering the relationships I desperately need. It's almost like I live in a fog and can't find the appropriate words to say or facial expressions/body language when I'm around people. My life is becoming one long cycle of watching myself sabotage any chance of relationships with others.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to overcome the need to isolate yourself. I'm tired of hurting other people who only try to help me out and coming off like a self-centered, emotionless, depressive robot when I do try to interact with others.

The entire time, I've been sorta just waiting for my 30-day trial of affection to be over and he'll ghost me. It has been over 30 days and a couple months actually. The other day, he asked if I got out of a bad relationship lately, bc I seem emotionally unavailable. It broke my heart in a million pieces and I wanted to cry. Then I just pushed it out of my head bc we were in a club at the time. And now that hes at work and I'm home. I just cried and cried right now bc I might fuck it all up even though I really don't want to. But bc I will trying to protect my heart - in result, I'm less affectionate and more stoic and not likable and in result that ruins the relationship. After my first bf 2 years ago, when that didn't work out. I sorta gave up. Then I meet a girlfriend who kinda was into just friends with benefits and told me how thats way better and I should do it. So after that, I just went on 100s of random dates, and sometimes I'll try get close to them or hang out more and not have sex but just get ghosted so I eventually just stuck to the mindset that, that'll be how it goes forever and I'll never have another boyfriend. I just settled with having that as a reality, thinking i still get to be less lonely while not attached with anyone so no one can ever break my trust again.

My job, my school and my friends really made me--me. I loved school, I studied art, so I would go to school even when I was off just to use the facilities. All day I'll be there with my lunch and my headphones, creating. And then I loved my job. It was an incredibly chill office job, where I didnt have to look busy, I could freely draw and read and search the web. I knew all the duties and never had to ask questions. I could go get coffee nearby when I wanted a walk. But it was only for students. On top of my best friends passing. I just feel so disconnected from life. Now I'm just a barista. working to pay bills and wait for the next shift.  I wake up , work. sleep repeat. I realize I may never get the life I want to live as an illustrator in my own apartment just happy and able to occassionally travel, work on art projects, have a good work-life balance. I just come to the conclusion itll never be that way and that I'll just be like my parents. Going to work everyday at a boring office customer service job that doesn't fufill me in anyway, but I know what to do, I do it and get paid. I go home and live for the weekend, but im too tired so I stay inside and watch a movie. I lose my hobbies bc who has time for that. And I die. I dont want to think about that.

My  company is great, my bosses are great, overall I come along with  everyone. But that's it, nothing more then coming along with each other.  My father die 1 Month ago because of lung cancer after fighting it for  alsomt 1 1/2 years. My girlfriend broke up with me shortly after. She  was pregnant. I was the happiest man on earth to be a father. After the  breakup she told me she would have an abortion and so she did. First I  lost my father, then my kid I never saw but already loved from all my  heart.\n\nI have a history with  depression and an anxiety disorder. The panic attacks started after  smoking weed and manifested into an anxiety disorder ( Mostly thinking I  go crazy or something is wrong with my heart). I had stationary therapy  2 years ago where I met my now ex girlfriend. Since then I am mostly  reliefed of my panic attacks, but sometimes they still sneak trough. I  take medication. It really helps with the panic attacks, but not so much with the depression.\n\nI have debts. Around 5000\u20ac. I see professional help for my debts at the end of January.\n\nCurrently  I live at home again with my Mom and my younger brother. I dont have a  room for myself and I am sleeping on the couch. I know my Mom loves me  and would do everything for me but we just cant live together. It doesnt  work. Don't ask me why, but we just have  different opinions on living  life.\n\nThat's my current situation  and mostly my story of the last years. First of all I am not suicidal,  but I would not be sad if I would die tomorrow. I feel empty. I have  nobody. Nobody I can talk to, nobody I can hang out with. All this stuff  on my shoulders and no one that helps me. I work my ass of at work  everyday because I want to get into a leading role in the company.  \nI  dont get a single message for a whole week. I deletet Facebook,  Snapchat, Instagram and no one even noticed. I try to connect with so  many people but it never works. No one seems to be interestet to get in  touch with me. I'm not an easy person, but I'm not terrible either.\n\nThis  loneliness and emptiness is killing me. I am a robot. Waking up, going  to work working my ass off, coming and and go back to sleep.

You have no idea how just 3 words, \"I LOVE YOU\", can light up her day... Those three words can make a huge difference... Sometimes with time we make the mistake of thinking \"I don't have to say it anymore, she already knows\" but I'm going to tell you that it's wrong... \n\nRemind her that in your eyes she's beautiful, that she's wonderful and perfect the way she is... Praise her everyday, remind her of the good qualities she has... Sometimes she might think that she's not good enough for you... Tell her otherwise... That she's giving meaning to your life with the sole purpose of existing in this world... That you are happy being by her side.\n\nIf she's feeling down, be there to support her... Listen to what she has to say... Hug her, caress her, show her some love... Remind her that she's not alone and you are there for her... That you will be always be there for her...\n\nSmall details are really important, like opening the door for her, holding the stuff for her, etc... Show that you are always thinking about her first... Even the smallest details matter... Surprise her with gifts from time to time...\n\nAlways make time for her... No matter how busy you might be... And treasure that time you share together... What else can make you happier than spending time with her?  Try finding things to do together.\n\nAlways give her the best of you... Remember that we are all humans, and we make mistakes... If you are angry, don't vent it on her... If she's angry at you, don't make it worse... Let her calm down... Don't make it worse... Sometimes we gotta take the first step, we gotta put aside our pride and apologize first (even if you think that you are right). Ignoring is not a solution...

But it got worse after getting diagnosed because i really didnt have the strength to deal with her, so she used that to take my phone, read my messages, make fun of my style, and so on. \n\nlast year i reached a point where i really wanted to die, and when she found out (my therapist was telling her everything since they both where friends), she came to me with a knife and asked me to please go and kill myself, that she didn't want me there. i was having lunch, in the kitchen, with my little brother.\n\nOnce i almost called the police, because she was beating me really hard for failing a subject. When i was about to do it she rushed at me and took my phone away. So when she had my phone i managed to escape, went to my room and started packing my stuff, i didnt mind being a homeless as long as i was out of there. When she saw what i was dojng she called my dad, and he convinced me to stay.\n\nNow, im in college, i moved out in september and she calls me everyday, she says she loves me and that shit. I feel bad for not replying with 'i love you' back. but its what i should do right? she is toxic.. \n\nLast friday i went to my psychiatrists appointment, and guess what? he told me that my mom loves me, but that she doesnt know how to express it. Now im lost. I feel like the bad person now, and i don't know what to do. any advice?\n\nthank you xxxxx", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T17:37:25+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T17:37:31+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 27, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebia97/mom_says_i_love_you_when_last_year_she_told_me_to/"}

I'm a sophomore in college, and for some reason I just don't know how to handle things like an adult. So I got really close with this girl and we kinda helped one another with depression and self harm and stuff. I was like crazy into her, and I still am, but she's currently seeing one of my oldest friends. She would come over pretty much every day in the beginning of the year, just to like hang out and talk and stuff, and sometimes my friend would be in the room, sometimes he wouldn't. After the first time he met her, my friend asked me if I liked her, and I said yeah, but I don't think she wants to be anything more than friends with me. And I was fine with that, just being in her company made every single day so much better. But then her and my other friend started hooking up. Me and that guy live in the same house, so she's here literally every night but I just never get to see her anymore and I hate it so much. Like I've had crushes before, and when they haven't liked me back it was just kinda like, oh whatever I'll just move on. I don't know what's different about this girl, but she's literally perfect in every way to me and the fact that we got so close as friends just made me fall like head over heels in love with her. It's ruined my relationship with my friend though; I never talk to him anymore and just avoid him as much as possible because every time I look at him, all I can think about is how she chose him over me and I just don't understand why I'm not enough. I hate feeling like this; I should be able to just manage my emotions like an adult, but she's the one person I can't get over. She's going through my mind every day, and I can't focus on anything. Me and the girl talked last night because we'd been arguing for a couple weeks, so it was nice to like smooth everything over. When we were talking though, she said that there wasn't anything wrong with me and she doesn't know why she chose that guy over me. It didn't help at all, I still feel like I could just be better, but I have no clue what I'm doing wrong. I feel like a complete idiot for not being able to handle this like a normal human, and I just resort to using drugs and self harm. It feels like I'm just so alone all the time and I don't have anyone. I've been thinking about buying a gun, just in case I get that bad, but I want someone to talk me out of it. It feels like I don't have anyone to talk to though... She was literally the person I would talk to about everything but now I'm just alone. I don't know if anyone is even gonna read this, I just needed to say something and thought that this was the best place for it. Hope all of you are doing better than I currently am! I also hope someone talks me out of buying that, because I'm so scared if I do buy it, I'll use it. I was thinking about calling the suicide hotline last night, but then I got to anxious and didn't. I don't know guys, I'm gonna try to talk to one of my friends about it, but I don't know how I can just bring that up without them freaking out/maybe wanting to just cut me out of their life. Lately, I've just been feeling like I should distance myself from everyone, so if I end up ending it all, no one will be to broken up about it.

It feels like after all I've been through no one cares. I feel like I've been left behind. I used to be a happy kid and I don't know what happened. Friends got tired of me, wanted to move away I don't know. I've blamed myself for so long. Called myself an incel. Tried to work on myself. Told myself that I'm not entitled to sex. It's fucking sad man. The way these incels are treated. They are hurting because no one like them and then people go up and just tell them that it's because they're shitty people. Maybe that's true but how the fuck does that help? That just makes them feel worse. I hate society man. I feel like I've been fucked in a way and now it's too late. \n\nI wish just one person would have come up to me and asked if I was ok or tried to give me a chance. I've been hurting for so long. I don't know what it is. When I was a kid and I was in emotional pain, people would reach out and try and make me feel better. After a certain point no one gives a fuck. They just see you and are repulsed. Want to get you out of their lives as quickly as possible. I'm just so tired man. I used to be funny, make my friends laugh, I felt really close to them and they just didn't feel that way about me I guess. I just want to die man. I really do. I can't make sense of my life, what has happened to me, or any of it. I spent over 10 years blaming myself for this. Please don't tell me that I shouldn't be angry. Because I pushed that shit down for so long. I blamed my personality for over 10 fucking years. I tried to change myself. I acted like I was happy, put a fake smile on my face when I went out, did everything fucking reddit tells depressed people to do. And nothing man. It doesn't work. It just kills me in the inside more and more. And now I've had it. Don't worry I'm not going to be violent or hurt anyone. I'd rather just leave this world on my own terms. I can't deal.\n\nAre some people just meant to be the doormats of this world? When other people feel sad or are hurting, people reach out and help. I might as well be a cockroach. No body fucking cares or has ever cared. What am I to do? I told the one girl that I clicked with that I loved her. That was like 3 years ago. We still see each other a couple times a year since she is a family friend. Needless to say our friendship or whatever we had is gone now. And she knows that I'm going through pain too. Fuck dude. I feel abandoned by the world. Like I've been left behind. And everyone on reddit loves to be like \"You need to make the effort.\" or \"No one is going to reach out unless you make the first move.\" Well to those people go fuck yourself. If you feel like everyone abandons you and leaves you in the dust, why the fuck would you grovel on your knees for them to accept you back? Societal outcast is what it is. When a community outcasts one of it's own, how do you heal that? Why was I left behind in the first place? That's what I want to know. Time and time again. I pray to god to fucking give me a sign or help to explain some of this shit to me but he never fucking answers. I don't even know if he is real. If he is he is an asshole because I've been stumbling through this shit life for so long. I'm never going to be happy again unless I have some kind of answer.

The Feeling Good handbook by David Burns has helped a lot of people, see for example this Reddit post:\n\n* [\"Feeling Good\" by David Burns changed my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CBT/comments/7rbnch/feeling_good_by_david_burns_changed_my_life/)\n\n**Where can I find it?**\n\nFind it here: [https://forms.gle/6mdPaSL8kjUQG6je7](https://forms.gle/6mdPaSL8kjUQG6je7)\n\nOr an image: [https://imgur.com/WjGJwkn](https://imgur.com/WjGJwkn)\n\n**What is it?**\n\nI made a simple tool (google forms) to record your automatic thoughts, cognitive distortions, and rational responses in a really low-friction way.\n\n**\ud83d\udc92 I have gotten a lot of value out of this simple tool and would love to share my positive experiences and get feedback on the tool!**\n\n**What is the triple column technique?**\n\nIn the book the triple column technique is explained\n\n* In the first column you write down your automatic thoughts\n* In the second column you pick one out of 10 cognitive distortions\n* In the third column you practice your verbal judo and talk back to your internal critic by responding to your automatic thought with a **rational response**\n\n**What are the 10 cognitive distortions?**\n\nPatterns of Cognitive Distortions: These are 10 common cognitive distortions that can contribute to negative emotions. They also fuel catastrophic thinking patterns that are particularly disabling. Read these and see if you can identify ones that are familiar to you.\n\n1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: You see things in black-or-white categories. If a situation falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure. When a young woman on a diet ate a spoonful of ice cream, she told herself, \u201cI\u2019ve blown my diet completely.\u201d This thought upset her so much that she gobbled down an entire quart of ice cream!\n2. **Overgeneralization**: You see a single negative event, such as a romantic rejection or a career reversal, as a never-ending pattern of defeat by using words such as \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d when you think about it. A depressed salesman became terribly upset when he noticed bird dung on the windshield of his car. He told himself, \u201cJust my luck! Birds are always crapping on my car!\u201d\n3. **Mental Filter**: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively, so that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors a beaker of water. Example: You receive many positive comments about your presentation to a group of associates at work, but one of them says something mildly critical. You obsess about his reaction for days and ignore all the positive feedback.\n4. **Discounting the Positive**: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count.\" If you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn\u2019t good enough or that anyone could have done as well. Discounting the positive takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded.\n5. **Jumping to Conclusions**: You interpret things negatively when there are no facts to support your conclusion; (A) **Mind Reading**: Without checking it out, you arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you; (B) **Fortune-telling**: You predict that things will turn out badly. Before a test you may tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019m really going to blow it. What if I flunk?\u201d If you\u2019re depressed you may tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019ll never get better.\u201d\n6. **Magnification**: You exaggerate the importance of your problems and shortcomings, or you minimize the importance of your desirable qualities. This is also called the \u201cbinocular trick.\u201d\n7. **Emotional Reasoning**: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \u201cI feel terrified about going on airplanes. It must be very dangerous to fly.\u201d Or \u201cI feel guilty. I must be a rotten person.\u201d Or \u201cI feel angry. This proves I\u2019m being treated unfairly.\u201d Or \u201cI feel so inferior. This means I\u2019m a second-rate person.\u201d Or \u201cI feel hopeless. I must really be hopeless.\u201d\n8. **\u201cShould statements\u201d**: You tell yourself that things should be the way you hoped or expected them to be. After playing a difficult piece on the piano, a gifted pianist told herself, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made so many mistakes.\u201d This made her feel so disgusted that she quit practicing for several days. \u201cMusts,\u201d \u201coughts\u201d and \u201chave tos\u201d are similar offenders.\n9. **Labeling**: Labeling is an extreme form of all-or-nothing thinking. Instead of saying \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d you attach a negative label to yourself: \u201cI\u2019m a loser.\u201d You might also label yourself \u201ca fool\u201d or \u201ca failure\u201d or \u201ca jerk.\u201d Labeling is quite irrational because you are not the same as what you do. Human beings exist, but \u201cfools,\u201d \u201closers,\u201d and \u201cjerks\u201d do not. These labels are just useless abstractions that lead to anger, anxiety, frustration, and low self-esteem.\n10. **Personalization and blame**: Personalization occurs when you hold yourself personally responsible for an event that isn\u2019t entirely under your control. When a woman received a note that her child was having difficulties at school, she told herself, \u201cThis shows what a bad mother I am,\u201d instead of trying to pinpoint the cause of the problem so that she could be helpful to her child. When another woman\u2019s husband beat her, she told herself, \u201cIf only I were better in bed, he wouldn\u2019t beat me.\u201d Personalization leads to guilt, shame, and feelings of inadequacy.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T17:12:16+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T17:12:17+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebhxgi/verbal_judo_v2_new_and_improved/"}

{"id": "ebhk0m", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ebhk0m/when_did_you_figure_out_you_were_depressive/", "title": "When did you figure out you were depressive ?", "author": "AmIJustSomeOne", "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI am used to browse this sub, but under an other account posting in other subreddits, so I just created an other not to involve friends in this.\n\n(sorry for the English mistakes)\n\nRecently (1 month ago) I was diagnosed depressive. I knew it. Since September I was just going back home, crying, eating, sleeping. I had my car towed, a close relative died, I was in a new university. Like everything was going bad. Every attempt by me to make new friends was a failure. I try to join a sports club, but I did not have the energy to actually do sports, and at the end of the training, I cried because I knew my mind won over my body.\n\nI saw everything I could lose : my relatives, my friends, my GF who is an incredible person. I could also fail my studies, be a sort of shame. It was so spiraling. I was getting out of control, dark thoughts every second, nothing I could do to stop these. I browse this sub and realized I was depressive. As many people recommended it,  I decided to go to a therapist.\n\nIt helped me a lot. The first few appointments were OK, I had the feeling of getting better a little. Then one of those awful weeks hit. I went to therapy and oh god, I never cried like I did. Like all the water out of my body during half an hour. I felt so miserable. Since one month, I feel like I am getting better. Did not have dark thoughts until today, they are back ...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of the therapy leads me to trying to figure out when I began to be unhappy and why. Even if September was the roughest of all months of my life, I had already been tired before and never reacted this way. So this is because of emotions, not because of tireness.\n\nAnd as I thought I had hit the most painful road of toughts, well I feel like I am heading to an other. I have been depressed for over 4 years. Since 4 years every week or so I cried but did not know why sometimes. At randoms moments during the day, during parties, I used to head outside, and cry. Sometimes a friend would come by and ask what was making me cry, and I could not answer ... I had everything : good friends, family, GF during a time, I was having good grades, but still. I felt useless. I felt alone. I feared to be alone so every evening I was spending it with some friend. If I had nothing scheduled, I would ask friends 'What do you do tonight ?'. If I happened to be alone, I was going to sleep very early as I had no hobby, I was unable to read, etc. For more than 4 years I have never been alone by myself longer than now, as I am in a new city. This is funny when I think about it haha :) Can you imagine the amount of money I spent in food and drinks with friends during all those years of not willing to be alone ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have a GF, and I really care about her. I do not want my depression to have an bad impact on our relation. She knows. But it is so so tough to prevent depression from reaching our relation. I care so much about her, and I want sometimes to close myself in so that I can heal, but I want her with me, I dont want to hide my fears, because I have been doing it for too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Why have I been imposing me this ? I never had some hobbies by myself. I am so anxious when I am alone. I fear of losing what I have, of being forgotten. This is so so painful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome days, I get frustrated of not being able to be like other people. I feel frustrated of others not being able to understand what I go through, and of only having 45 minutes of therapy per week at most to try to heal myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been in a toxic relationship with myself. And today I realize this toxicity is destroying me and I need to react. But I am still suffering, how to get better ? I know I should try to get better by myself, not considering what I could lose, but how ? How not to be anxious when fearing to lose friends and GF when you try to heal ? I already see some friends taking distance as I feel bad and begin to talk about my depression. And in my family, we are not the best speakers for the 'how-do-you-feel-today' part.  From this toxicity against myself, I developped obsessive behaviours, if not maniac stuff : I must always take the left side of an obstacle, I check everything several times. It also created insecurity in my relations with friends and with my GF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in a part of my life (I am 22) where I need a lot of energy as I am beginning an important step in my studies, in my relationship also, but I feel like I am going to lose everything. \n\nFinally, I am wondering if I might be on the Autistic spectrum. I realized there are some behaviours that might hint this : I cant maintain eye contact except for a very few people (my GF, my parents and some of my siblings, that is pretty much it) and always felt unable to maintain it long with friends. I am kind of skilled in what I study. I dislike when there is too much light, too much people, too much noise. I cant focus on what I do, except for my study stuff, for a long time and always think of something else. But I use to be a social person as well. I use to walk around when I think about something, like if I was walking in my little world.\n\n I told my therapist and he did not seem very conviced about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think ?", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T16:45:08+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T16:45:10+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebhk0m/when_did_you_figure_out_you_were_depressive/"}

I'm a 22 yo female, the guy is a 21 yo male. We've been friends for more than 5 years. I had no romantic interest in him till last spring. In fact, he proposed we become friends with benefits at some point, which I turned down because I just wasn't interested at the time. He confessed to having wanted to kiss me during one of our hang outs, but not pursuing it because he thought I didn't want it.\n\nThis March, too, I started developing something for him-getting excited when he texted me, being bubbly and happy after hanging out with him, becoming jealous when he mentioned a girl was pretty, etc. We heavily made out one night, at my proposal and I confessed my feelings for him a few days after-which he turned down. We kept talking, though, and we ended up having sex at his proposal-which he felt kind of bad about after, since he felt he had used me.\n\nI got into another relationship around that time-a really nice one, but it lasted only 3 months(that's for another post). I really thought I'd gotten over him by that point, but I still had self esteem issues from the rejection(which I'll elaborate on in a moment). Though, last month he got a girlfriend and it really killed me emotionally.\n\nSo, concretely, my problems are: 1) Us being friends, over the years he told me about all of his crushes/girls he's attracted to. I swear to God it's EVERYONE except me-and he doesn't even seem to have a type or like a particular kind of personality. This makes me feel like I'm somehow inferior or defective-that everyone else is pretty and I'm not, like every other girl is normal and I'm not, like I was born missing something. I RATIONALLY know this isn't the case-I've dated and been pursued by \"higher up\" guys than he is-better looking, more confident, etc. who had no interest in those girls, but emotionally it still feels like shit.\n\n2) He got a girlfriend and gosh i have the hugest inferiority complex towards her-she's extremely pretty, extremely cultured-, has the best taste in books and music, is artsy a high school valedictorian, tweets the wittiest jokes AND seems like an incredibly kind and fun person. Rationally, I know that I'm all these things and also have qualities of my own, but I cant't persuade my emotional side. I can only think of how lucky she is.\n\n3) Aside from my insecurities(which I seriously don't know how to get rid of), I just can't get this situation out of my head. I literally wake up and the first thought is \"he has a girlfriend\". I sometimes can't relax or do anything nice because it just pops in my head. I've tried to get my mind off things, to do some volunteer work or hang out with friends, but then I'm like \"SHE doesn't need to do that to feel good, she's happy and loved\". I wish my parents had made me like her instead of like me.

I stole again and again until she had noticed and told me while she was crying that she thinks that I was stealing the money.

Feel like I've been saying a \"year ago\" for the past six, but realistically I think it's actually been a year and 1/2. Not sure what information is necessary, but just wanted to provide some background. I was originally put on Zoloft. Hated it. Got on Wellbutrin, and it made me extremely anxious, but more productive. Short after, my doctor suggested I paired it with Prozac.\n\n More recently, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed 20 mg of adderall. All three diagnoses were a long time coming, but if I'm honest the ADHD almost brought me relief. Part of me feels like it all finally makes sense now--the depression and anxiety. Feeling helpless for so *long.* Maybe that's why I felt relieved? \n\nI'm a sophomore in college (went away for college last year--transferred back home due to mental health) with maybe 25 credits to my name because I'm so damn terrible at finishing things I have started. \n\n**One of those things being** ***my medication.***\n\nEveryone in my life has always been extremely supportive of everything I've done and all I have been through. When I came back to attend this \"new\" University I was looking forward to a more comfortable start close to home. I'd been taking my medications consistently over the summer. I'd forget once in awhile, of course, but I tried hard to be on top of everything.\n\nWhen September came, all my initial excitement and anticipation had faded. I started to forget to take my medication a few times a week before my boyfriend spoke up and encouraged me to set a reminder on my phone. He set one too. *Easy fix.*\n\nNope. Even with the reminder, I started to notice I would think about my medication and it's location, but I wouldn't take it. Sometimes I'd think about my meds two, three, even four times throughout the day. Often, all three pills would be within arms reach (usually in my backpack since I spend the night in various locations), and I would still choose to leave them in the pocket. \n\nSo, of course, I start doing pretty shitty. Sleeping a lot. Falling far, far behind academically. Holding it together better than I probably should have mentally, but that was when I wasn't trying to get in a nap or two. October flies by, and I have my medication with me all the time, but I just let it sit there.\n\nAt one point (Mid November?), I even go to pick up a refill for prescriptions that I haven't even finished the previous bottle of (mostly so my mom would stop nagging me). \n\nThis behavior went on until about a week and 1/2 ago. My mom knew I had stopped taking them and begged me to make some changes. Regardless, I have successfully, unintentionally? *intentionally without thinking too far into it?* tanked all my grades this semester. I'm looking at straight F's if my professors don't excuse my absences with the note from my therapist. Classes end this week. That's not my main concern, though.\n\nSo, I've been taking my medication consistently for almost two weeks now. I even arranged the next month's worth into one of those containers that organizes pills by the day. Now, as I write this, I'm sitting in bed just looking at it. I can't decide if I want to put the three of them down today or not. I know they're there and I've been thinking about them all morning.\n\n***\"So why don't you just take them?\"*** My mom, boyfriend, and a series of other people ask. I don't really know. That's why I am posting this. **Does anyone else struggle with this at all?** If so, have you identified why? I don't want to believe that maybe I am just too lazy to grab the pills and swallow them, but I don't think that is it because I have exhausted a lot of energy just thinking about their existence and about how I *should* just take them.\n\nI feel like I should probably mention that I haven't had any bad side effects from any medications I've ever taken besides sleeping a lot on Zoloft. All they have ever really done is helped me so I don't understand why this is such a power struggle for me almost daily. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

When I confronted my mother about this she said she was working and could not afford the toy, this was because I had loads of Lego and all of that stuff. I remember this as a horrible excuse to say that my mother was poor, but my 10yr old brain did not understand stand that. So I told my teacher about this and she freaked out. And that was only the beginning.\n\nA short time after (maybe 5 or 3 days) I told this the teacher invited me to a meeting with the child welfare. They had pressured me to tell them that my father was hitting me and doing all kinds of bad stuff to me. As a 10yr old I did not understand any of this. I just wanted the toy. And I know that I may have been selfish but, hear me out I was a 10yr old. \n\nThe talks continued and slowly I was realizing what what happening. How they pressured me and how my father was talking to me how I should not talk to them about stuff. \n\nThis was the first stage I'd my depression. I felt guilty of what I was saying and wanted to dissaper. I slowly started to get rid of these thoughts. \n\nAnd now for the second stage. 11yr old was in bed and suddenly heard a cry. I went out if bed to go to the living room. It was my mother and father arguing. This was shocking to me and I was scared. My parents just told me to go to bed. After that day my parents told me that they were getting divorced. This hurt me badly and I started to get these toughts that it was my fault that they had divorced. \n\nCurrently\nIt is 8 grade and I meet this dude in school, anom. I started to get along with him good and we started talking alot to each other. He told me that he was a semi-gangster that was dealing with drugs. I say ok to try weed and it was cool. \n\nBefore I tell more I am a very emotional dude who can cry like 123.\n\nI started crying whenever I smoked and that's when I realized I had depersion.

Sleep hasn\u2019t been easy to come by. \n\nMy beautiful daughter is a teen who is fighting this awful battle everyday. The enemy is invisible, attacks her even when she closes her eyes, and I\u2019m terrified of losing her. Between the doctor visits, medications and therapy, there simply doesn\u2019t seem to be any respite from it. If I\u2019m feeling this drained, I can only imagine the nightmare of how she is feeling. \n\nWe have a very strong relationship and she is comfortable in talking things through with me. I\u2019m her mum, I will always be a safe, soft spot for her to land on and rest. I give endless hugs, stop whatever I\u2019m doing if she needs my time, and basically make it part of our routine that I\u2019m available 24/7. Is it 2am and she\u2019s in crisis? I\u2019m up in a flash to stay with her, hold her hand and listen. I have even taken a leave from work because she is my priority and I am able to financially. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m reaching out to you fine people is that I need to know if there is anything specific that I should be doing in addition to what I already am. My girl isn\u2019t even beginning to surface from the murky depths. The panic attacks, the insomnia followed by days where she isn\u2019t able to get out of bed on her own, the inability to eat an actual meal (weight loss is becoming a big issue), the crying and berating herself for \u201cbeing weak\u201d (her words), additional worries about her education because she just can\u2019t make it through the school day...so many facets of daily life have become impossible for her. \n\nIn patient treatment has been discussed with her doctor as well, though she begs me not to go down that road. It\u2019s tough to know what\u2019s the best thing for her. Do I have to push harder in some ways to help her? Do I keep doing what my heart says and listen with loving support? She calls herself weak but I always point out that her asking for help took so much strength. I do my best to show her what an amazing and strong person she is. That this disease can be treated and life can have colour again. She\u2019s got to keep trying, even if it means that the day\u2019s victory meant that she got a shower and dressed. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a personal support system for myself as I navigate through it all. Her father makes demands of her to just take a deep breath and get on with things. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work that way! I now have to supervise what and how he says things to her for obvious reasons. I\u2019m at the mental place that dictates I\u2019d rather her need to do a grade over vs forcing her to jump in the deep end and drown. \n\nSo please tell me what has helped you or your loved one.

I spoke to my cousin and my aunt and they said that I just need to give her time and space and I can contact her again sometime in January and see how shes doing. According to my aunt (who's read up on studies about BP Depression since my cousin is the same) told me that she only means that she cannot maintain a regular friendship right now while she's battling. She most likely doesn't want to end our friendship permanently but she cannot treat me as a friend now. Part of her depression right now I have a feeling is because of this break-up, as she seemed genuinely happy with me and the pressure from her family to keep me only made things harder for her.\n\nI'm deeply in love with her, and I'd gladly trade lives with her if it meant getting rid of her condition. People keep asking me if I am okay with being with someone like this, and I've already answered this question multiple times. I wouldn't have continued dating her if I wasn't already okay. She told me about her condition on our first date. I knew from my cousin how hard it's going to be but I was prepared. I just hope we can meet up again next year maybe around Feb-March and talk again. Ill most likely NOT try to get back with her as it isn't the best thing for her right now, but down the line maybe sometime mid 2020, I'd be happy to give it a 2nd chance.\n\nI'm still in a bit of pain, especially before my Birthday &amp; Christmas right around the corner.

Well, actually, I've been feeling this way for years but it's been getting worse and worse. I recently went to the doctor, and she was so happy because I lost 50 pounds in about 8 months.

I'll spare this sub the details, but I signed up for a clean energy program that was supposed to assist in helping the environment and also save me money on my electric bills.

Don't do anything for me. Sometimes I even feel pissed off from looking at certain memes or something. Even my favourite show, South Park. No. No reaction. Video games, nothing, except for the feeling that I am bad at all the games I play, even after doing so for years.\n\n\nSometimes, only at night, alone, I feel really sad, I wish I could just go back to when I was little, everything was good back then. I had friends, I was thought of highly, but now I just feel like an outcast and got kicked out of my friend group because of a series of problems. One of them smashed my watch and they all laughed about it right in front of my fucking face. High school is tough, I may be well off financially and I have a loving family but I feel hopeless, I suck at everything I try, motivation is at 0.\n\n\nI'm only 13, but I think I may be depressed. I've taken online tests, but they aren't really reliable. Once I turned to alcohol and that is probably the first time in a year I had felt happy for an extended period of time. Most of the time I feel sad or empty. Just nothing. I haven't really laughed my ass off at a joke, meme, video, TV show e.t.c since 2017. I did think about suicide, once, but I'm worried about what's on the other side. It could be hell, it could be nothing, I don't know. I'm thinking about trying weed with a friend but that is just a cowardly escape.\n\n\nI don't know, am I depressed or do I just think I am because it's 'cool' or 'edgy' or something.

We talked a bit and agreed to break up because we currently have our issues we need to fix first and because we wanted to try again someday so we don't want to destroy the relationship beyond repair. She's suffering from depression for years now and we had a good amount of time where she didn't feel depressed but it didn't last long due to a very toxic work environment which affected our relationship a bit too much. Obviously. \n\nFast forward to the present, I still talk to her regularly although it's expected to not be the usual normal cheerful way couples talk and instead it's mostly me just being there for her because she's feeling really sad.\n\nTherr are times where she'll just be straight up really mad at the world including me (I've hurt her a lot of times too admittedly and I started the fight which led to the breakup) and she'll just say something like \"Why are you still bothering me?\", \"I'm not worth it.\", \"Leave me alone.\", \"You should have left my life alone.\", etc and I honestly don't know what should be the right response so I just tell her thst I'll still be beside her and that she's not alone but since she has depression it's going to take more than those words to make her feel she's not alone.\n\nAlso, when she's extremely angry or sad she says something about being really tired, wanting to quit, and that I should stop bothering with her and just leave her alone. She says all these in an angry kind of way so I don't know if she really mean it that I'm adding stress by trying to talk to her or she's just pushing me away because of depression. I don't know what to say especially during those times. Should I really give her some space and not initiate conversations or be stubborn and stay with her even if she keeps telling me not to because there are times where I couldn't still be there for her hence sometimes there are false hopes? Take note that she's really alone, only her best friend and me are there for her because her parents aren't that keen to mental health issues and they're not really the great kinds of parents. So I fear that if I stop initiating conversations, she'll feel even more alone especially since she's isolated and leaving alone with suicidal tendencies lately by how she says she just wants to give uo especially since she just quit her job which was good because of the toxic environment there.\n\nI really just want her to heal and be happy. Even if we don't get to try again. As long she's safe from suicidal tendencies and she gets to heal and achieve her dreams, I'll be really happy even if I'm not part of her lifr anymore, I really just want to help her.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T13:50:56+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T13:50:58+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebfdj3/my_partner_is_suffering_from_depression_i_need/"}

All good friends of mine except for a few people, it seemed like everyone had a lot of fun except for me. Right now I\u2019m only in touch with 3 of them because I cut most of them off during a really bad time of my life, around February this year. I didn\u2019t think about it much back then, because friends come and go and it\u2019s not like I cut them off for absolutely no reason, they had hurt me and abandoned me at the time I needed them most and it felt right. Around that time, I also started realizing that my then therapist wasn\u2019t really paying attention to me and she only offered to consult me about once every 3 months which was not enough for the state I was in.  I\u2019m terribly scared of change though and she was my therapist for 3-4 years + the person to diagnose me with depression so I admit I felt like I should stick with her. Feel like I should add that at some point she told me there\u2019s no true hope for me because the way I think and my character itself is depressive, not only because of my illness. Still have no idea what tf she meant by that lol but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nForward to now, I started my first year in college and expected to make new friends naturally but that never really happened. I stopped going to college within the first months because I was dissatisfied with my major and I was so fucking depressed I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed to go grocery shopping for myself. Finally changed doctors and started new meds and it feels kind of right, I\u2019m happy with my new doctor. I had a hard time with the side effects of the new meds and I have to take like 4 of them a day but other than that I\u2019m hopeful. So I currently hang out with the 3 people I\u2019m still in touch with and 2 other people I met through them. I tried to reconnect with my ex best friend and apologize to her for cutting her off and she was so kind about it, it made my whole week. We met up and we\u2019re talking regularly again but something doesn\u2019t sit right with me, I feel like I don\u2019t have anything to talk about and it\u2019s completely not her fault, I just feel like my life is so empty that there\u2019s really nothing to converse about. \n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to me, I used to be socially adept despite my anxiety, I used to be able to make people around me feel comfortable and happy that they\u2019re hanging out with me. I feel like I grew into a weirdo that no one wants to be around with because of how silent I am all the time. I\u2019m in a constant state of apathy to my surroundings. I can\u2019t even fake it till I make it anymore lol. So today is my birthday and I am 18 and I am most likely going to spend it alone because I feel like my 3 close friends are fucking growing tired of being my only friends and the only people I talk to anymore. I don\u2019t know if I should try to start over and learn how to make friends from scratch again. I wish someone could convince me that this is temporary but I\u2019ve been trying to tell myself that this is just an unfortunate but transitional phase for a year now.

Slip to the end If you want the tldr version\n\nSo in order to ask for advice I feel I need to give a little backstory of my situation. I'm a 25 year old man who up until recently when I finally straightened my life around. When I say my life was in shambles, I was selling dope at 16 and popping so many xanax that I went on a binge and blacked out for an entire week. People think this is a blatant lie whenever I tell this shameful story but it's TRUE, I'm still dealing with the side effects of bar coma.  For a long time I had full body tremors, please nobody take offense to this but my cousin has torrets and he saw me twitching one day and nearly made me to to see his doctor because he was that concerned.\n\nBY 21 I was addicted to smoking heroin (I never shot that crap, I hate needles. I even hate watching people shoot up because its kinds terrifying. I was now doing  anything I could get my hands on (no crack or meth though, I really dont like uppers. I much prefer downers) I was wasting my life away because i was going in and out of jail which totally made my depression worse since mental health counseling dosnt exist in tdcj. I could have used my intelligence to help benefit society at least to improve the human race somehow. but I chose a temporary feeling over the feeling of having achieved something great in life,or built, or drawn. something or even won an episode of Hells Kitchen! but currently I'm just being a general waste on society.\n\nAt 24 years old on june 7th 2018 i said enough is enough and decided to get clean and sober for good this time, not one of those \"well I'll officially be done after my last hit\" bullshit. Nah, this was cood Turkey just sweating bullets and trying to max out my xbox gamerscore since I felt like I was physically dying so there's not much else to do. Then the depression kicked in. I've never felt so low in my life than when I was goin through heroin withdrawls. It's truly a weird feeling wanting to die just because your going crazy for not being able to sleep and anything you eat just ends up being thrown up. But its the price I had to pay for messing with that horrid substance. If any of you gentleman/gentlewoman are reading this and thinking \"ahh snorting one line wont do anything, trust me the road only gets longer snd longer. \n\nThrough all this my father was very supportive. Hed been through somethin similar in Vietnam and he prepared me for what to expect and what I needed to buy and also items to stay away from.\n\nMy mother knew none of this because she was raised in a very closed off household, like no tv, all her teachers where nuns. She still has scars on the top of her hands from being hit with a ruler or whatever was in reach.  the only books they where around to read are the bible, stuff like that you know? I've seen her try and physically assault a man smoking a joint in amnsterdam because all her life she was told how evil the drug is and all that nonsense. It's insane right? Insane as in those old school anti marijuana ads from probably the 50's-late70's I cant tell you how many fights we've gotten into because she used to hit me with a closed fist when she'd catch me smoking from one of those cheap 5 dollar pipes youd get at a gas station. When I'd watch the woman take a xanax and wash it down with a glass of wine.  At. 11am. In.The.morning. I guess this was back in the days of the pill mills because I have no idea how she had literally 15-20 fuol to half full bottles of xanax because \"I'm a failure and she dosnt understand why I csnt be like my sister\" \n\nSo when I initially approached my dad and was truthful with him about my heroin addiction he didnt seem angry with me, which I thought was slightly weird.  He told me to sit down and wed discuss our next plan of actions. He told me \"son from the moment you where born I promised to god that nothing would come between you and my love and I refuse to give up on you now\" my dad continued to tell me about my mothers upbringing and how she would essentially disown/shun me for the remainder of my life since she still believed in this ridiculous brainwashing horeshit. So my dad and I decided was him and I would go on a father sun \"vacation\" but in reality I went to a rehab program in houston texas. My dad truly is the best man in the world, even though he lived 3 houre away from my rehab he still came every single day and ate dinner with me. I truly wish I could do something or just anything to make it yo for him. I want him to know that my love for him is undying and that even though we have butted heads in thr past, hes my roll model and who I look up to.  My mom on the other hand was on one of her usual xanax benders so who knows if she even realized we had left the house let alone the state. I honestly feel like her neglect has caused some of my problems that I deal with as an adult. Especially trust. My parents are pretty wealthy but since my moms a lill popper and constantly in party mode with her \"girlfriends\" I was never tought how to spot people who want the genuine best for you and the other majority who see me on my for thr cash in my pocket. That definately caused many many broken hearts and destroyed friendships because i was too naive and trusting in everybody's good nature.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks of hell I was finally free to return to my normal life. While i was in rehab i decided it would be best if i stayed in Houston becausr i didnt know anybody so it's not as easy to pick up dope from. I got a good job through a friend i met in my program and life started improving dramatically (who woulda thought?) My relationship with my parents drastically improved, probably not lying and stealing to fund a stupid enslaving habbit helped a lot lol. But once I got off the dope the depression kicked in like a jack hammer. I couldnt eat, I had no sex drive, I mean I didnt even have the willpower to speak to a member of the other gender. I was to the point where I'd rather just go home and play Playstation 4 or outer worlds on xbox one (if anybody would like to play with me dont hesitate to message me. We can get through this permanent heartache together)\n\nNow flash forward to 2 days ago, my depression is somewhat under control. I still have my days where I just wake up and know it's going to be one of those days? Where as other days I feel like there has never been a more incredible day that this earth has seen. My mom calls me out of the blue and asks the typical christmas questions like \"what do you want for your present\" \"have you bought your sister anything\" and just asking me to bring some food for christmas dinner with the whole family. We talked about just normal mom and son stuff you know? I tried to explain the status of the Imperium of Man in the 41st millennium to her\" she said she understood but I dont think I'm too great of a story teller for her to grasp the concept lol\" we end the call by making plans for Tuesday night to have dinner since she was gone on thanksgiving and we where unable to see each other since she was visiting my dog.\n\nWe ended the phone and I start playing god of war, you know just taking my son on an adventure he'll never forget. I mean who sees the world serpent) and about that time I get a text from my mom saying \" I owe you an apology. I'm sorry but I don't know if I can have you here in the house for Christmas.  I need to think about it a bit..  Give me a few days. I'm sorry for speaking before thinking. Probably why I'm still awake. Love you. See you Tuesday.,\" this was all apparently because I was smoking heroin over a year and a half ago. I even offered to take a blood test, urine sample, or she could pull some or my hair but apparently that wasnt good enough and I dont know what to do. I havnt toughed drugs or alcohol since June 7th, 2018 ( I'm not gonna lie to you, I still smoke weed so I guess I'm not actually sober, but that's truly it. I take it to sleep since I have insomnia and I refuse to let my doctor prescribe me sleep meds because I know how addictive my personality is. so now I have no idea how she knows.  I'm not angry at whoever snitched to my mom, I'm just truly disappointed ya know? Everything was handled so discreet. I know for a fact my dad said nothing to my mom because he promised me when hed help me get clean he would not mention what I'm going through or have been through to anyone unless I give him permission because as in his words \"it's not my place to speak on another mans buisness, especially when hes trying to better himself. \n\nI'm truly hurt by this because everything was fine less than 20 mom ago but now I dont know what's changed. I know I've been a major fuck up kn the past but people can change for the better right? I'm not trying to open a whole other can of sorms here but my sister stole literally $22,000 dollars from my parents and she suffered no repercussions, nor does she get excluded from things. I was caught smoking weed in 8th grade and went to prison for two years for having a single thc wax cartridge.  and for some reason people seem to think that's a capital sin that's going to lead you straight to prison like those old school advertisements.\n\nMy question to you wonderful people (I'm so sorry if that's not the proper pronoun you go by, I feel dead inside and my brain dosnt seem to want to work completely at 6:35am.\n\nHow should I approach this? I know its just Christmas dinner and its not a huge deal, but the fact that my mom called me and invited me and asked me to bring food makes me unsure how to feel.\n\nBesides feeling heartbroken because my own mother dosnt want to spend less that 4 hours with me once a year hurts. It truly wants me to say fuck it and go grab a 20 sack and just forget how the devil walks around in a 5'2\" 220pbs white woman who loves to day \"bless your heart saeetie\"\n\nThe best thing is about The text she sent me basically saying I'm not welcome in the house our family grew up in. What should I say to her? Should I leave it alone? Thsts what I've been doing so far.  I didn't wanna risk upsetting her since my dad is pretty positive shes bipolar or has some sort of personality diseass. \n\nMy next question is should I ask advice from my aunts and uncles? I know most of yall will maybe say no because my aunt/uncle will just run to my mom and say \"look what your son said\" but my aunts and uncles arent like that. Yeah family is incredibly important to then but so is the truth in the matter. All 3 of them will not make a decision till they have heard all the facts from each side. And yes I know someone is gonna say but isnt there s little bit of bias since I'm trying to win my moms sisters into my side, I'd say yes there is just because they are related. My aunts are all incredibly intelligent women and I dont think they would have gotten to their current positions by sticking to and playing one side. But I dont know, even though with everything I said in the last paragraph I still think one of my aunts and maybe my uncle will show boas twords my mom.\n\nI love my mother dont get me wrong reddit, she has her flaws but shes been there for me when I need her.  Granted it wasn't as often as she needed to he which caused me a lot of problems when I was in middle school and highschool. But who doesn't have faults? If my writing gives you the idea I hate my mom please realize it's the opposite. Our relationship wasnt healthy fir quite a few years but now that I'm getting older our relationship is improving at a vast rate.\n\nDo you guys/gals have any suggestions on if I should respond to her text or if I should just let it be and see if she is willing to make the first move? As I've said this crushes me inside and breaks my heart and all I want to do is be able to spend time with her because i was in jail from 18-20 and i desperately want to get those years back with my mom since she refused to visit me, which I dont blame her. I knke how hard it was to see my dad behind a few inches of glass so I can only imagine how badly it woulda hurt her. I've been feeling great since I got sober but this is starting to drag me back down that deep dark hole again and I dont know what to do. I have trouble talking about my feelings in person. If I'm talking to someone on the internet or basically not face to face I have no issue I guess because it gives me a lil more time to plan out what I'm going to say.  If anybody feels like shooting me a message and just talking about anything, I'd greatly appreciate it. We can talk about the weather, or if folding pizza is the right or wrong way to eat pizza, or we can continue the eternal debate of of Magnus did nothing wrong (gosh darn it erebus)\n\nOr so you think I should give her space? Let me know what you think. My mom dosnt seem to love me the way i love her but i dont know if i should keep trying or if i should give up.\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated. If my story is out of order or there are spelling mistakes. I'm so sorry, my anxiety from everything that's happened tonight has kept me from being able to fall asleep so I'm sure there are spelling mistakes somewhere in this essay I wrote lol.\n\nI've bad to cut off all my friends from childhood because they are all addicts now and I feel like since I did that all I can do Is sit at home and do nothing since i refuse to be around people who could put me in that situation where I'm tempted. So like i said, if your ever bored and need one extra person for a game of xbox or ps4 let me know! I'd love to join ya even if yall are strangers haha.\n\nThank you all from the bottom of my heart! If you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll answer them as best I can. I'd like to try snd fix this problem not lie to myself and act like everything is fine.  If there are any sections that are confusing or dont make sense definately let me know! My depression has been causing my insomnia to come back full force so I've been unable to sleep. Thank you all for reading!\n\nEdit: edited a few spelling mistakes and runnon sentences.

It would mean so much to me If just one person could read this.\n\nAbout a week ago I finally had the medical appointment at cahms in the UK (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) and I was talking to some guy about everything, and he asked me about if I ever felt suicidal - there was a huge silence and I stupidly went even farther than talking about my thoughts and told him that &gt;!I had the rope ready, !&lt;which has coincidentally disappeared from it's hiding place, I managed to keep one of my sharpener blades though. He invites my Mum back in and asks her if she thinks there are any triggers to my self-harm, and I wish I was lying when I say the first thing she said in answer to that was \"she hurt herself because I took her phone away\" and I immediately try to explain about distractions, and how when It's the middle of the night and there's nothing to distract myself from all the pain with, It's either cut yourself or go that one step further. And the doctor tried to explain to her that it's not that simple. But here we were last night with my Mum taking my phone at 8:30 pm sharp, because she knows best and she \"can't sleep knowing I'm on my phone\" but apparently can sleep when I'm cutting my arm to pieces.\n\nAlso. telling me to \"try not to focus on my emotions\" is a very helpful thing to say, seeing as I don't feel anything anymore. You might have known that Maybe if when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts to you you hadn't told me I was \"Just using it as an excuse, to get what I want and to blackmail\".\n\nI got diagnosed and prescribed 10mg of some medication that I've forgotten the name of, cause my Mum won't even let me hold the box or get my own tablet out, cause I'll *probably* try to down all of them.

Now I don\u2019t feel like much and I have no friends.\n\nSo anyway, I\u2019m really fucking bad at communicating.

I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right to sit there and be like \u201coh that\u2019s so horrible...\u201d and then move on...\n\nMy girlfriend also said that talk to people very badly too... honestly I believe her even if I don\u2019t mean to. I\u2019m bad at replying over messages and I\u2019m very condescending but honestly for me, being condescending is an improvement because I\u2019ve never had any emotional control and I\u2019m trying my best to learn it! I think I haven\u2019t been around people for so long that I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll reject me so I either leave first or I push them away because I know it\u2019s easier to not help myself than it is to try to. Yikes, am I right?\n\nI used to be so angry about the world and now I\u2019m just negative and I express it to everyone I talk to, like, I constantly go on rants about the things that I\u2019m bothered about instead of \u201cbeing in the moment\u201d. I\u2019m also hella materialistic but I\u2019ve never had much and I feel like I always need to prove something to people but I know that looking good on the outside won\u2019t change the awful, depressing girl on the inside.\n\nRealistically, I know that nobody cares about what bothers me (I promise I\u2019m not moping about it it\u2019s just a fact and I see it too) but knowing that makes things harder. I don\u2019t know how to act differently and to get over the things that initially bother me in that moment. I\u2019ve been told I think I\u2019m better than other people and that I act like it too... but I don\u2019t! Maybe I do? Maybe it could be a defence mechanism? I honestly think everyone is better than me...\n\nDoes anybody have a similar issue? I don\u2019t want to feel like this forever but it\u2019s been so long, I don\u2019t even know if I have the emotional availability to be friends with somebody at this point but I am SO lonely and I have been for years.

I have fragmented memories of sexual abuse, parents who made me feel worthless, and eventually my first girlfriend betrayed me.\n\nIt was junior high,we kept our relationship a secret, little did I know she was also dating another girl in our friend group at the same time. Even went as far to have us both over at the same time on multiple occasions.  We both confided in each other that we were dating the same girl.  Well, I was the one not good enough, so she continued dating the other girl then later in our adult life, became best friends with my friend. Ugh.\n\nI attempted suicide after this.  My step parents were awful they called me fat, annoying. Looking back I wasn't really that fat but I wasn't skinny either.  They would buy food for their kids and make me feel bad if I ate any. Like, do you really need to have a slice of birthday  cake.  This led me to hoard non perishable food in case I got hungry and didn't want to deal with their judgy eyes. Did they really need to treat me like this?  I grabbed every pill I could find and took them. I did not realize how sick I was going to get.  I puked and puked til there was nothing left.  I don't remember much other than the puking and taping out asking my friend to take me to the Er. When I came home after a stay at the stabilization unit. I told them it was because of my ex gf, I didn't want things to be harder for me. \n\nI eventually met my now husband in high school.  We grew together but also ensured shit together.  How naive to think that watching porn was cheating, I was so insecure, I only found out when my credit card was charged\n\nThen it was the emails and dating sites. Each incident ending in a fight, where yes, he did mess up, but I needed to be stronger emotionally. At this point I had not been on any medication. He could not cope thinking it was his fault I wasn't happy. \n\nHe eventually had to work up north a week at a time. When he came back he would be home while I worked because not everyone can work a week at a time.  We got into one of our rare fights where I told him he needed to stay and he threw me to the ground and left.\n\nFast forward to five years ago. We have been through all this through 10 years, want sure we would ever get married at this point. But we continued on.\n\nHis birthday came around and we had a threesome with a friend and he took it too far and came in her.  I wondered how stupid he could be that it took us years to get to that point that he does this with her?  I would think he could at least finish with me.\nI left and cried.  I wanted to die, but I let this happen. We ended up breaking up. I was so depressed I lost my sense of taste. I spent Christmas alone. When we were on the mend I found that my ex best friend was hanging around him.  I thought okay she has a boyfriend and i moved the town over that it was unfair of me to try and deny him comfort.  One night he told me he would call me when he got home but I never received a call. It had been snowing and I feared he had been involved in an accident. I called and called with no answer. Later that week I found that this friend of mine had slept over that night and she was telling him not to go back to me.\n\nHe says it was when he got too drunk he couldn't sleep and then fixed the curtain rod that she started seeing him as a better partner than her current bf, which she did end up leaving in the end.  She knew he was handy, dad material, good job, sweet, ect. And started flirting with him soon after he fixed the curtains.\n\nI was devastated. While I had worried about him, he was banging my ex friend. Why did I let this keep happening. Why did I want to go back to him.\nDid he help develop this anxiety.\n\nIt seemed the moment i let my guard down, my heart took another hit.\n\nIt wasn't until I accidentally came across an email where he wanted to pay for sex. It never went further than that one email. I've had it. I told him he needed help and he was going to therapy or I was done.\n\nTherapy taught him how to cope. And we were happy. We finally got married, we even have a healthy baby together. Things are good. My life is so whole now. \n\nI was blind sided when I heard this girls name at dinner. My SIL mentioned their wedding and how unique it was and I started crying.  I couldnt help it.  My eyes welled up at the dinner table while all those feelings came and slapped me in the face. While I'm living my best life.  After a childhood of dreaming of a family dinner, I'm now eating that dinner with my family and I'm sitting there stifling back my tears because I had let my guard down. I feel so much trust for my now family that I was reminded it is too good to be true, right?\n\nMy husband realized I had not properly dealt with this and offered to talk. I was so angry at the person he was before therapy but I feel so u justified to be angry because it is all in the past.\n\nI'm hurt, I'm scared, and I want to be stronger because I also have a new baby that needs me to be at my best. He's been really understanding of my feelings as he's going through an illness of his own and he is starting to realize how much I really care for him and he promises I won't have to go through any of that again.  \n\nI doubt anyone has cared to read this far but I need an outlet.\nI hope I'm not a fool in this.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T12:31:17+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T12:31:18+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebek3c/always_betrayed_by_those_close_to_me/"}

Although the first time I tried was back in 2012, I swallowed shitload of medicines, paracetamols, 2 fist full of them, but I was fine in 2 days, long story short I have had a very rough year, ranging from insecurities, being bullied, harassed, picked on and have had my family turn against me, heck I've even had my heart shattered into a million pieces..by that I literally mean shattered. Still recovering though, all these events that folded made me insecure and made it hard for me to trust any one, some days I feel like I can trust my best friend the most and some days I feel like I can't. Imagine trusting someone so much and having stomped on..the effect lasts long. I have had argument with another of my friend who was a really good friend..he became a jerk when I told him I couldn't lend him the money when he asked me for it.. He used to be so fucking nice..and I can't even imagine he would accuse me of being a \"motherfucker\". After all the times we've helped each other out. I have written 2 suicidal notes on my laptop throughout the past few weeks, no one knows about it - just me. I won't go into the details about just how all the events folded this year, but know that I am normally a very soft and caring person, I blame myself for being born this way, I absolutely loathe myself, I've failed in 2 businesses I started. Heck I didn't even manage to graduate my high school and the regret lingers on, it sometimes makes me wonder if my girlfriend sees me as a failure too? Because my parents sure do. Of course I am not here for any sympathy from any one. I am simply not worth it. Of course people feel sad sometimes, but they have people to talk to, and they can. I can't I physically can't, I  feel lonely and I go into solitude just because I don't want to hurt anyone with my ill mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I had this gush of feeling that sent me spiraling down this lane. It's not one of \"those\" days where I feel like I'm ok and the next moment I feel suicidal. Those days are still controllable but today if different, I feel so much rage especially with everything that's going on around the world. There is no sign of humanity and love left. Know this that I am not that person who takes suicide lightly, so know this I am not fucking OK. The insecurity from past months still lingers on, the bullying from my past still lingers on, some days quiet, some days intense. I don't want to hurt my girl , she is the best anyone could ever have. I don't want to hurt my parents, they are the best anyone could ever have, but I am fucking suicidal right now, I have cried so much today that I'm feeling numb to the pain. I feel so much hurt that it makes me tremble.. I feel like a mess explaining myself on the internet.. I guess its my last resort to not hurt the people I love the most. I feel like nobody takes me seriously ever, I feel that no one cares enough and I am tired of trying to be OK, I am just tired. I am heading to the beach once again... Please don't tell me to be thankful for life. I didn't ask for it, I want to be unborn right this instant because no one wants to understand me.. I was told that we will get through this together no matter how long it takes but I don't think that is in effect anymore.. I have been and am a victim of depression but i try to cope with it. People don't realize that for people like me it only takes one word to give that \"nudge\" towards killing oneself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway if you read it till here thank you so much for your time..

She eventually calmed down when I was 6\n\nBesides her, I would suffer physical and emotional abuse from my maid at the age of 6 to 12. She would pinch my eyebrows whenever I try to sleep and she would shout at me over small things (like if I wanted to watch tv she would yell at me to go to my room). This cycle would literally occur every day. I remembered crying in my room literally every day. There was this one time I woke up at 8 am and decided to make myself breakfast. While pouring milk into my cup, she went hysterical and screamed behind me, yelling at me to go back to my room. I stood my ground and shouted at her. That's when her eye got so big; you could see the anger on her face. She ran to get a knife and slowly turned around and started waving the knife at me. I remembered running back to my room, crying for what felt like hours. \n\nI was also bullied badly in school while this maid drama was going on. There were these twins who joined my school in grade 4. They absolutely destroyed my life. They took all my friends away from me. They made sure everyone hated me for no reason. We were friends for a while but just when I told some secret that my mum smoked, they made sure to tell every fricking one, even my mum. Omg I can still feel the betrayal and fear I had when I was 10.  It was so hard in school since I had no one; I was lonely when I was in school and at home. I remembered coming back from school, crying myself to sleep every single day.\n\nIt was so hard for me. Being bullied in school and coming back from more abuse from my maid. Till today, I still have anxiety attacks when I see the twins anywhere or when someone brings up about my maid.\n\nSo at 13, I have had transferred to a different school. I thought my life would be better since my maid had left for good and I wouldn't have to see the fucking twins in my school ever again. But things got worse for me. People in school would give me an attitude because my skin colour was different from the majority of my school. My \"friends\" would backstab me and go outings without me. And over 2 years, I'm all alone. again. It really seems like I can't maintain any friendship I have ever encountered.

My best friend/almost boyfriend had a friend over this weekend, so naturally a number of nights out and days out happened. I know this friend quite well, I thought, so I was looking forward to seeing him again and catching up. Tbh, I was looking forward to catching up with everyone because I\u2019ve been the biggest recluse for the past few months. \n\nSo, I\u2019m talking to my best friend on Friday,saying about how much I\u2019m looking forward to going out with everyone on the night. He doesn\u2019t give me a straight answer on what\u2019s happening, so I wait. And I wait. And it gets later and later and l don\u2019t hear anything from anyone. I get upset because I start overthinking- have they gone out without me? What did I do wrong? Do they not like me? I don\u2019t drink much because I get sick easily, is that why they didn\u2019t invite me?\n\nEventually, after a night of panic and crying, I go to sleep. In the morning I message my best friend again, asking what happened. He still hadn\u2019t replied to my last message. Eventually, at around 4pm, I get a short reply of \u2018me and my friend just went to pub for a bit, you live far away so it wasn\u2019t worth you coming\u2019. At first I think \u2018ok, that\u2019s fair enough\u2019 because it does take me around an hour to get to where he lives (same city just bad public transport). So I ask how his night was, he says it was ok, and I move on. I\u2019d planned a big night out on Saturday with everyone, so I was looking forward to that. \n\nSo, I\u2019m sat at home all day (my family we\u2019re away across the country). Part of me expected a \u2018want to come for food?\u2019 or something, since his friend was only here for a few days. I didn\u2019t get anything, so at around 5pm I ask my best friend what\u2019s happening about the night out, what time we\u2019re going etc. I get a reply saying everyone is out at the minute, and have been all day, so he doesn\u2019t know what time they\u2019ll be going. I read the message and get really upset, because why wasn\u2019t I invited? Did he really not want me around? We were meant to be together, but he\u2019d gone out of his way to avoid me this weekend. I overthink everything again and come to the (maybe logical) conclusion that they all hate me and have been laughing behind my back. I get openly angry at him, just wanting a proper reason why he\u2019d been avoiding me when just 2 days ago he\u2019d been saying how much he liked me.\n\nEventually, I calm down- there was no point spoiling the night I\u2019d planned and been looking forward to for so long. I message later that night asking about timings again, and arrange a meeting place etc. I start getting ready and packing my bag (because I was staying at my best friends house). Then I get a message from my best friend saying he doesn\u2019t know if he wanted me to go. I ring him, asking why. He says he doesn\u2019t think it would be a fun night with me there, because I\u2019m upset and he doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. At this point I\u2019ll clarify we\u2019re basically together, so I was a bit taken aback by him saying this. It was a complete turn from the original plan, when he sounded happy to have me there. So obviously I start overthinking, cry all my makeup off, get really really sad and start just feeling suicidal. I really couldn\u2019t get my head round my best friend, my boyfriend, not wanting me at a night out ID planned. I message him saying how upset I am, and he rings me saying he\u2019ll come round to my house to make sure I\u2019m okay/don\u2019t do anything stupid. I say alright, but say he doesn\u2019t have to because I know he wants to go out. At this point I kind of expect something, but the replies stop. I start to feel worse and worse, like spiralling. I message him asking what his plan is, whether he\u2019s still coming because I didn\u2019t feel safe on my own. No reply. \nI sit awake all night crying, wondering why my best friends care more about a night out than making sure I\u2019m ok. My best friend knows how bad I can get, but still he didn\u2019t seem to care. I end up ringing my mum for help, but she couldn\u2019t do anything because she was away. Eventually I go to sleep, I wake up in the morning at around 5am feeling just as awful as I did before. I check my phone hoping for a reply of any kind- nothing. I check Instagram, only to see a story from one of the people that went. It\u2019s a big video captioned \u2018best mates\u2019. Low and behold, there\u2019s my best friend, drunk, having the time of his life. It dawns on me that none of them really cared, not even him. I message him again saying I\u2019d seen the video, and that I didn\u2019t want to see any of them again. At this point I had it in my mind that this video was posted purposely to make me upset (it probably wasn\u2019t but idk that\u2019s how my mind works). I\u2019m hysterical, crying for hours and hours until my parents come home and then I just cry at them some more. I explain the weekend and they assure me that my best friend has been out of order. \n\nSo Sunday continues and I\u2019m crying for a good portion of the day. I can see he\u2019s online, just ignoring my messages. Eventually I get a message from another friend asking if I\u2019m ok, and if I want to go out for food to take my mind off everything because he\u2019d been telling everyone what I was like at the club the night before. I reluctantly agree and go. At first I start to cheer up, finally feeling a bit of relief from the awful weekend. Until my friend tells me that, no, it wasn\u2019t a few pints at the pub on Friday. It was a full blown night out, and everybody went. Everyone but me, who was ignored all night when I\u2019d made it so obvious how much I wanted to go. So obvious. Now I just feel like I\u2019ve been played, like he could\u2019ve lied about so many things. Did he get off with someone? I wouldn\u2019t know, he\u2019d lied about going out. \n\nas the day goes on I decide to bite the bullet and meet up with him, hoping to get things sorted so I didn\u2019t feel awful anymore. I needed to work on Monday, so I had to feel somewhat capable of getting out of bed. So I ring him, because he was still ignoring my messages. He answers, and agrees to meet up so we can talk. We agree to meet in the station here, since it  as late and quite empty. About 5 minutes after I ended the phone call, he arrives. But not just him. Everyone. The same crew that went out on friday, all day Saturday, Saturday night... all of them were there to spectate and see how upset and mental I was. I felt sick. I was so angry he\u2019d brought an audience of my friends to watch me have a breakdown, especially when he knows how anxious I get. \n\nSo I kick off at him, saying I\u2019m not talking to him while they\u2019re around. He\u2019s reluctant but agrees to move away from them so they can\u2019t hear us talk. Then we proceed to be there for about 4 hours, talking and talking. He refused to accept he\u2019d done anything wrong, no matter how I explained how bad it made me feel. He said he was right to prioritise the night out over me, because he \u2018thought I was ok\u2019 and \u2018knew I wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid\u2019. The thing is, I really did consider it on Saturday night. What if I had? I was so upset by his blatant dismissal of how I felt, I just didn\u2019t know what to say. I questioned him  on Friday, asking why he didn\u2019t invite me and why he so blatantly lied. He first denied lying, until eventually he said he didn\u2019t want me to go because I ruin the night all the time and he feels like he has to take me home etc when I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m just confused, because I\u2019d drop everything to make sure he was ok. I\u2019d go home from a night out to make sure he didn\u2019t kill himself, so why wouldn\u2019t he do the same for me?\n\nEventually it gets to the relationship stuff, and he tells me he can\u2019t be with me anymore. Why? Because he doesn\u2019t want to deal with my depression. He doesn\u2019t want to have to talk to me when I\u2019m depressed. He doesn\u2019t want to be there for me. Although I\u2019d do anything for him, he won\u2019t for me. He tells me that nobody would want to deal with me. Nobody would ever want to be with me because I get depressed. He says he still wants to be friends, but he doesn\u2019t want to hear from me when I\u2019m depressed anymore. This is the person I confided in the most, dropping me because I\u2019m too depressed. \n\nWeirdly we left on forced good terms, he took me home to make sure I was ok then left. Obviously as soon as he left I felt so empty. So horrible. I cried all night, because nobody actually cares. Even the people that say they do, don\u2019t. I have a massive panic attack, end up messaging him for any kind of help because nobody else is awake, and he replies \u2018can\u2019t talk now I\u2019m watching a film\u2019 then ignores me.\n\nI haven\u2019t gone to work today, I can\u2019t do anything. I don\u2019t know what to do, when all the people I consider my friends think I\u2019m too mental to want to have anything to do with me. This has happened before, with every friend I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m just unlikable, unlovable and destined to eventually end my miserable existence.

There's no reason to me not feeling safe enough to tell them what I'm actually feeling, I've never fully expressed my actual inner thoughts to the full extent that they reach. I made a private snap story with the people I trust the most on it so I can actually get these thoughts out, just very toned down obviously. It has helped a bit, getting something out is much better than keeping it all inside and never telling anyone how you feel. The people I have on it respond to it often and are very supportive and always tell me how much they love me and all that stuff. And I'm very thankful for that, don't get me wrong, but I kinda feel awful that im not truly expressing how bad shit is getting. For instance, for the past few days I've been seriously considering suicide if I get put back in high school classes. I go to a highschool program on a college campus, so you have to basically prove yourself worthy that you can take the actual college classes that they let you take after you've proven yourself. This semester I pretty badly failed my Calc 1 class, and for a lot of cases when people fail a college class, they get sent back to highschool classes for a semester, and those classes are actual hell trust me, I'd rather take another calc class. I had been going for a Math &amp; science degree until this point, and early on in the semester I realized I absolutely hated what I was doing, and that just turned my mental health to absolute shit. Whatever I did, I just couldn't get motivated to pass the class, and I could never find a reason to do good in the class, I never even went to the final. And with all that explained I can get back on topic sry lol. I'm really really fucking scared that I'm gonna get put back into highschool classes, I haven't been told if I'm gonna be sent back yet or not, but it fucking terrifies me that I might get sent back. Being sent back to those classes for a semester would put me at my absolute lowest point I guarantee it. I've been seriously considering suicide if I do get sent back, because I don't think I could handle 15 weeks of those anymore, my mental health was bad enough when I was first taking them to prove that I could take college classes. The other class I took this semester went great for me, it's a great example that I can pass college classes with good grades. I haven't told anyone about these worries, or that im seriously considering bad shit if it does go as wrong as my mind tells me it is, I'm scared to tell them because i think it's going to hurt them, which is the worst fucking feeling. unintentionally hurting people with your own hurt is the worst fucking feeling in the world.

It was overall a really lighthearted movie but at one point the main characters say:\n\"let's play a drinking game\" \n\"what about a cutting game?\" \n(this shit was not funny, added nothing to the rest of the movie and kinda mocks self harm to be some kind of \"fun\" after school activity)\n\nAt this point my heart sinks in my chest for a moment because i had self harmed that same morning.

I make distinct choices, but, my inner desires seem to always preside. I took a 5 hour energy today and experienced way too much erratic movement to focus on the exam that I was studying for at 1 in the fucking morning because I had never studied for the class in my entire life and btw that exam is later today at 10 am. I'm the cause of all of my failures. I want to change my behavior--I say this all the time. And it just seems that I always fall into the same pattern. The key concept here is that there is no \"it gets better\" there's only \"a temporary time of content that which will pass by the never-ending pain and sorrow of being an inconsistent bastard\" I'm late to honestly everything. Instead of complaining about my shit I know that I need to get up off my ass and do the work to ensure I don't end up in a pattern like this again, however, I continually wobble between being alright and being holistically saddened by any discrepancy that interrupts the new path I had been trying to forge to betterment. I critic myself way too much. I obsess about the right way to do things. The right way to eat, exercise, socialize, flirt, joke, work, learn, teach, write, etc. (the previous sentence was in the order of my most consistent thoughts about myself these days). I hate the way I look. Whatever I do to feel alright is never enough. I'm told by several people in my life that the way I think and deal with the things that plague me is unhealthy. I stress myself to sadness. It starts off small then grows and grows until the belittling I instill upon myself has reached an entirely new level as I realize any terrible thing I, or others, have had to say about myself is true. I am the person I try so hard to not be. The entire month of November I spent smoking and drinking, hanging out with friends, staying up past 2 am, barely putting effort into school, and avoiding working through the self-esteem issues I was having. My self-esteem has reached a new low!! I haven't felt this worthless in the longest time. I feel so inept--it's funny, really. I mean, I'm pathetic. I'm really fucking stupid in the sense that I can't get myself to do the simplest of tasks. December has been fucking rough. why the fuck do I keep typing in short sentences. I have so much trouble taking care of myself. It's that I don't care. I remind myself that I should care and the fact that I'm not caring for my body further pushes me into the depths of my despair. fuck why is this edgy. this is so stupid. I can't bring myself to open up to a partner because I'm so scared that what I share or whatever relationship we hold means little to nothing to this other person. I know I'm not lonely because whatever I'm feeling isn't a loneliness, I've felt that before. I feel anxious at multiple times of my day. I make as many connections with people as I can, but I don't share so much my personal issues because I don't think they need the burden. I have a frantic need for socialization as it distracts me from my responsibilities. The thing is, I want to be vulnerable with people so bad. I want to be able to feel unwavering trust for another person so bad. But, I can't help feeling that everything someone tells me is a lie. I truly feel crazy. I can't trust my fucking self to stick to my obligations and to decipher the truth in the words of another person. No one really cares for me. All anyone wants is someone to complain to. I don't like complaining as it makes me realize how stupid my complaints really are.  I'm literally so dumb. I'm a fucking idiot. Can we just take note of that fact that the entire time I wrote this lengthy shit that I'm sure no one will read because of how long it is, I was supposed to be studying for my final. ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I also laugh as an automated response to discomfort, stress, and pain. This much is true. I think. Idk if I used that right bruh im so dumb I need to study. this was so erratic holy shit my bad aahahahahahahahahhaha im sorry if this doesn't belong in depression but I've been in tears for about 80% of the last 2 weeks because I'm really shit.

I've been eating poorly and my sleep schedule is all over the place. My grades have been dropping. I've started from not drinking a drop of alcohol to becoming wasted every week this school semester.

to become the best at whatever i set out to do - pretty ambitious yea, but i was 12 give me a break. what i really wanted was to get into the university that - if i made it through - would set me up for life in the best possible way. i'd make my parents happy, i'd be happy, i'd have my friends by my side, and everything would be great. but that vision started to fade on march 21st 2014. that fateful day in eighth grade where my life started to crumble in front of my eyes.\n\nabout 4 months prior, i'd submitted applications to a magnet high school and an ib (international baccalaureate) high school - those that would give me the best chances of getting into my dream university. but on the day that decisions came out, i watched all of my friends get into the school they wanted, while all i saw were rejections. at the time, i figured it was a minor setback, i'd still go to my local high school and crush it there and make it in the end, boy i couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nin high school i watched myself get my first c's ever, and at that point i thought it was over. sophomore year i fell from rank 1 down to rank 151. at the time, i figured if everything else went well, i'd be okay, that i'd still be in the top 10 in the ranks of my class, and everything would work out in the end. but in those 3 years i watched myself tear apart friendships and give up everything i used to care about for school. i thought to myself, it would all pay off in the end, my hard work and determination would let me win.\n\nsenior year, up to that point i had taken 12 ap classes, while still taking 6 more that year. it was the toughest and most mentally consuming year i'd ever been through, and at the end of it, i came out at rank 8 out of 650 people, with just 2 c's on my report card and the rest a's. along with this i was a part of multiple honors societies, ran varsity cross country for 2 years, running on the team for 3 years total, and taking some of the hardest classes my school had to offer. and at the end of it, i watched history repeat itself, and went through the same grief i experienced 4 years ago in middle school. i watched all my friends get into their dream schools, while i got into just one of the 17 schools that i applied to. \n\nthis was just under 7 months ago at this point, and i had given up everything for this, and yet, my efforts were in vain. i stopped trying for anything, losing my drive and my will to better myself and become sufficient with what i had. i watched as my parents started arguing with me a lot more, telling me that it was my fault, that i could have done better, and me wondering how i could've done better than my best efforts. i've stopped trying in almost every aspect of life. all my friends that i had in high school and middle school don't even know what school i go to, and i can't be bothered to let them know at this point. and everything i've worked up to and sacrificed has all been for nothing. i want to keep trying and say that even though the last 8 years didn't go my way, maybe something will change.\n\nbut i know nothing i do will change the outcome of my reality. so i've stopped trying - i've stopped trying to make friends, i've stopped trying to find interests, at this point i've stopped trying in school, now getting c's in classes that i breezed through in high school. i've stopped trying to better myself as a person, i've stopped trying in life, and the only thing i haven't stopped yet is living.\n\ni've learned in the last 8 years that life isn't fair at all, and sometimes even your best efforts aren't enough. but if my best efforts aren't enough, then why bother?\n\ni'll give myself and this life one more chance to let me win, after being beaten down for the last 8 years. i'll give myself until next november to try and find a reason to change and become better. because if nothing's gonna change in the next 11 months, i don't expect anything to go better for me until i die.\n\nsorry if i've sounded pretentious or arrogant that i should be able to breeze through life without lifting a finger - i don't mean to sound like that at all. i'm just tired if giving everything i got and getting fuck all in return.\n\nthere's a lot that i didn't cover here that i don't really care to unless you want to hear it for some reason. i guess i just need to find something to care about that doesn't make me feel like an utter failure.\n\ntl;dr - i used to be good at everything but for some reason am no longer good at anything and i'm giving up.\n\nthanks for reading this - please don't try to help me, i'm sure i'll figure something out sooner or later.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T08:51:21+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T08:51:21+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebco3y/ive_watched_my_life_fall_apart_in_front_of_my/"}

And the people I'm around are only around because the feel like they're obligated to be, aka my family.

But nobody cares, and I cant believe it. I feel so hated, like it's supposed to be this way. Like maybe I've never even been the slightest bit likeable ever. And the thing is people used to care, at one point my family was so much gentler and kind and compassionate with me. And I used to have a lot of friends. But now I can feel how I'm bringing everyone down when I talk to people in my family. It's been so long since I've had someone just hug me and try to understand. It's like everyone just gave up on me. Most of my friends left all at once, and the rest trickled off one by one. The last friend I had (who unfortunately I had feelings for and still kind of do) stuck around for a lot more than the other and I thought maybe they'd be the one I could count on. But of course, they stopped talking to me and I still dont know what happened. Now I see them interacting with their new friends on social media, and looking out for them and saying nice things. And I'm happy that at least they're doing well, but I cant help wishing they would still be there for me.\n\nI cant even make one single friend, and it's been three years since I've been trying. And I've been trying so hard. I feel so alone and trapped where I am, I just cant take it anymore. I want so badly more than anything sometimes to get better and prove to myself that I can do it. But other times I'm reminded of what's going on, and I'm really afraid that this is it and theres no way to get out.\n\nI kept thinking to myself that I would never post here because it would be admitting to myself that things are actually this bad.

I had this one friend who was the most negative person I have met in my life. These are the following things she has said about others: \u201cI do not want to marry someone who has genetic health issues running in his family\u201d and \u201cI want to get into Medical School to become a radiologist so I make big bucks and don\u2019t talk to people\u201d you get the picture. \n\nThese are the following things she has said to me; pathetic, dumb, dumb ass (I don\u2019t even remember the rest). She would make lots of morbid jokes and suicide jokes. In fact, the last time I hung out with her in person was with our other friend Anna* and she told me how she wanted to get a tattoo on her arm. As a joke I told her she should get my face on. She said that she would add a noose around my neck and have the rope trail up her shoulder. I was mortified. When Anna left, I confronted her and told her that it wasn\u2019t cool and she said \u201cI\u2019ll try to not be a douche bag next time\u201d. Later I confided in Anna and she told me she took it only as a joke. Weeks passed and I couldn\u2019t shake that off. I decided to have a talk with her on the phone. I told her how I found her judgementalness to be difficult because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s judging me or not and how I\u2019m afraid about expressing myself. She told me she doesn\u2019t judge me. Then I told her that the joke really bothered me because she knew I was suicidal and dealing with depression. She told me (and I will never forget these words) \u201cI can\u2019t know what you expect me to say\u201d and that was it. I knew then and there our friendship was over.   Anna was still friends with her.\n\nNow it\u2019s been two years, I transferred Universities for other reasons. Just last night Anna had a birthday party. People could sleep over if they wished, I didn\u2019t because I knew that my ex friend would be there. (Anna told me she was coming and that I don\u2019t have to come if I don\u2019t want to). I decided not to sleep over because I wasn\u2019t sure if she was. She ended up sleeping over. \n\nThroughout the evening Anna was oddly friendly towards that ex friend, for example, calling her babe numerous times and after reading her bday card say \u201cawwww baaabe\u201d and my card she didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nNight came and I was tired. My friend and I were making plans on what time we should leave. The ex friend peeped up and said \u201cyou guys should do the skid-addles soon\u201d. Basically, I felt very uncomfortable and awkward and out of place. I felt like I was the bad guy and Anna was just pretending to be my friend or something around those lines. I felt very unwelcome and I regret going. Right now I\u2019m quite upset and I\u2019m seriously questioning my friendship with Anna. She does not try to keep in contact with me regularly and she would text me once every two, three months (she says she\u2019s too busy because of Nursing school). I\u2019m at my wits end. Should I just keep her as a casual friend? Or should I burn this bridge? I\u2019m really not sure what the best option would be and I\u2019m so confused about my feelings. My depression has been getting bad and I\u2019ve been crying lots. I just don\u2019t feel like I have a friend I can really rely on. I always feel like they will get annoyed with me or something. I just wish I have a best friend.

Now I am 110% sure.\n\ntried trusting people this year after years of being a distant nonperson, and all it got me was a broken laptop and legal threats due to rent arrears I wasn't responsible for too  (I allowed myself to be naive, thinking that people are inherently good and don't want to hurt one another).\n\nI had a breakdown earlier this year at the end of July, in reaction to the betrayal of one of my previous housemates (who sent the entire sum of the rent money to his child support instead of to the landlord resulting in us getting evicted) and the overwhelming hostility of estate agents and other bill collectors who want money that I am unable to produce (and they know this but yet they treat you like a criminal regardless).\n\nI started crying at work and couldn't think properly, thoughts were racing and I felt like I wasn't in control. I haven't felt like this in a while, but I could feel myself losing control. I told my boss that I had to leave and that I was too stressed/depressed to function as I felt like I was going to quit my job on the pot and that would only fuck me up more and was the worst thing to do. I left and ghosted my work for the next week.\n\nDuring this week I almost went to the hospital, this is big because I don't really recall a time in my life where I have been to the hospital for a general checkup as my parents are pro homeopathy/anti pumping your body full of drugs. every time I suggest that I go to the hospital because I think I have a problem (have mentioned my heart before but it has been written off has likely indigestion) they say don't go because whatever problem you have they will prescribe you drugs and there are alternative solutions than drugs. \n\nAnyway I digress, I almost went to the hospital ready to confess all the reasons why I think that I am depressed and check out the myriad of physical health problems that I also possibly have, but didn't manage to find the energy to fill in the appropriate form (and didn't have 2 forms of proof of address) so just didn't.\n\nsince then I think I have been having a depressive episode, I say think because I haven't had a diagnosis but regardless, everything went dark here.\n\nI started showing up late to work more, I started smoking more weed to deal with the increased amount of stress in my life. I started doing more risky things (i.e things at work which could get me in trouble/doing MDMA whilst knowing that my heart doesn't feel as healthy as it should be), but I didn't break down again after this. I just kept going, because if I let myself lose control again it would all be over. game over. can't lose job can't lose house not allowed to not have money.\n\nactually got through the house situation and managed to find a new place to live, but since then I have pretty much ceased putting all effort into my life.\n\nOver the last 2 months I have:\n\n\\- Stopped cooking for myself, all I do I eat crisps and chicken slices from the corner shop everyday, I know this is unhealthy. I am unsure if I am doing this deliberately in order to harm myself or if I just don't have the energy. regardless I know it is significant because I have dropped from 72kg to 66.5kg from this new 'diet'.\n\n\\- I have gave up on my New Years resolution to stop drinking energy drinks, now drinking 2 a day (one before work, and one in my break) to make my work day as easy as possible. the reason I stopped in the first place was because I felt it was negatively affecting my heart and I still believe this to be true but don't really care anymore.\n\n\\- Continued increased substance abuse, primarily smoking lots of weed to stop me from feeling negative thoughts and help me get to sleep easier, but have also had increased alcohol use, alongside some MDMA, and Cocaine (which I wasn't even planning on trying but did it on a whim, which is very like me I guess but not necessarily the controlled decision I would like myself to have)\n\n\\- Stopped brushing my teeth (brushed them under 10 times in last 2 months)\n\n\\- started stealing from the company I work for, not for profit, but instead to spite the company and to distract myself from my negative thoughts  by focusing on how/what I am going to steal . \n\n\\- intentionally relapsed into an older financial addiction in order to cripple myself for December.\n\n\\- complete neglect of living situation cleanliness, not quite neckbeardnest level but close\n\n\\- I am a passenger in my life, just watching it happen, not putting any effort in beyond the bare minimum.\n\n\\- ALL THOUGHTS ARE NEGATIVE, ALWAYS ANGRY ALWAYS SAD NEVER FREE\n\nLmao are you still reading? \n\nI have spent the last 6 months pondering whether I should kill people or not.\n\nat first I think I wanted to kill people (not anyone specific just killing for the sake of killing) because I felt as though I wasn't in control of my life and I wanted to be heard. and you can't really ignore someone who kills someone. but that's a stupid thought, would just end up looking like some crazy fuck and get thrown in prison. I wouldn't allow this to happen, I would kill myself before allowing myself to be locked up for the rest of my life. so maybe this wasn't about regaining control but rather me contemplating committing an action that would push me towards ending my life. I have tried to end my life before, with copious amounts of alcohol and a walk down the motorway, but ultimately decided that I am young and owe it to myself to at least let myself try in life before I decide to end it prematurely.\n\non the same subject with the uk general election coming up (and now gone, fuck the Torys) , I am hateful of our government and large corporations exploiting so many people. why is it ok that some people are earning \u00a315k a year after taxes and some people are earning \u00a3800k a year. these people are evil. if you put me in a room with someone who harms more people than the benefit they bring to this world, then I reckon I could kill them only feeling but a modicum of guilt. there are bad people, they have lots of money and this keeps them in control, people have been fighting against this inequality for years. the only way to stop them is violence. democracy doesn't exist.\n\nI don't want to kill people nor am I currently anywhere near doing it (don't have a plan, the internet says plans make it serious), I just don't think killing people as black and white good or bad we are made to believe.\n\nI work alongside someone with a net worth of \u00a3400m, I disagree with his existence entirely but yet I have not had a plans to be violent towards him. I respect him as a person and would like to talk to him about why I think this way and his view on this. I isolate myself a lot and sometimes get into thought bubbles, talking to people who think differently from me helps get a more realistic view of situations. but I don't think this will change my opinions.\n\nI want a peaceful future but I do not think I am getting it. violent protest is the only way to stop the rich.\n\nseeing people in their 60s working the same shit job as me is the opposite of hope, even if I do have a successful life will I really be happy if so many people are not.\n\nI don't know man, I am on edge. I don't want to destroy my life but a feel myself losing control more and more. I just want to drop out of society and lay down to die. I am hard playing against myself at the moment. but hey at least I'm still showering. \n\nI don't want to live in a world that is so hostile and unfriendly towards its people over money, it disgusts me and I want it to change and if it that is ultimately futile I will leave this world and put my trust in whatever alternative death may bring.\n\nIn the new year I hope I find the courage to go the doctors, before I harm myself anymore. I think a diagnosis will help me to assess how I am going to progress with my life and remove at least some of the uncertainty I have about the future\n\nbut for now fuck it all, gonna keep floating and try to not to die, because that's what life about right? hahaha...", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T06:02:11+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T06:02:12+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebb5nm/i_dont_want_to_wear_sunglasses_anymore/"}

I\u2019d been depressed over the summer and had recently broken up with my first girlfriend about two weeks before college started so I couldnt wait to be out of my house and make new friends.\n\nI am rooming with two long time friends and the first three weeks were great, kept my mind off the break up and was making new friends. But quickly my mental health just plummeted. I found myself getting really angry at my roommates and friends and felt like I was a bit bipolar as my mood would go from good to bad back to good constantly throughout the day. I was also seeing a massive decline in my self esteem, which has always been low ( I don\u2019t think very highly of myself) but I started shit talking myself in my head. I started telling myself I was boring, unfunny, stupid, a nuisance, told myself I was ugly, and even convinced myself my friends hated me. As time went on it only got worse and my emotions were all over the place. I\u2019d cry in my room and then 5 minutes later be out laughing. For the past month or so though I stopped feeling happy. No more mood changes. Nothing. Just unhappiness and it\u2019s really started to wear on me.\n\nI\u2019m still able to hang out with friends but it just feels forced. I feel like I have to be there and fake a smile, participate in conversation I really dont care about. I\u2019ve lost interest in a lot of things I enjoy doing and I\u2019ve just become numb. It hasn\u2019t affected my work though, one of the few things I pride myself on is my work ethic, but it has affected my grades. I\u2019m struggling to maintain a 3.0 gpa and get the hope scholarship which pays for 80% of my tuition and this has only made things worse. I feel extreme guilt for being lazy and avoiding school work until the last minute and getting shitty grades but I just can\u2019t force myself to care about it anymore. Eating has become a challenge too, I eat 1-2 meals a day and have lost about 10 pounds and I\u2019m already skinny as shit.\n\nLife has really just become a drag and I feel empty inside, I have no real ambition to do much of anything and I don\u2019t see myself going anywhere. I just see myself as a burden to my friends and family. I\u2019ve been losing contact with a lot of my friends and I\u2019m scared I\u2019m just going to end up alone by next year.\n\nIt\u2019s also very hard for me to make friends on my own, I have really bad social anxiety and I don\u2019t really meet anyone new unless I\u2019m with my close friends, it gives me comfort and helps me feel comfortable socializing with new people.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T05:59:11+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T05:59:12+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 6, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebb4h7/first_post_on_reddit_ever/"}

I have fragmented memories of sexual abuse, parents who made me feel worthless, and eventually my first girlfriend betrayed me.\n\nIt was junior high,we kept our relationship a secret, little did I know she was also dating another girl in our friend group at the same time. Even went as far to have us both over at the same time on multiple occasions.  We both confided in each other that we were dating the same girl.  Well, I was the one not good enough, so she continued dating the other girl then later in our adult life, became best friends with my friend. Ugh.\n\nI attempted suicide after this.  My step parents were awful they called me fat, annoying. Looking back I wasn't really that fat but I wasn't skinny either.  They would buy food for their kids and make me feel bad if I ate any. Like, do you really need to have a slice of birthday  cake.  This led me to hoard non perishable food in case I got hungry and didn't want to deal with their judgy eyes. Did they really need to treat me like this?  I grabbed every pill I could find and took them. I did not realize how sick I was going to get.  I puked and puked til there was nothing left.  I don't remember much other than the puking and taping out asking my friend to take me to the Er. When I came home after a stay at the stabilization unit. I told them it was because of my ex gf, I didn't want things to be harder for me. \n\nI eventually met my now husband in high school.  We grew together but also ensured shit together.  How naive to think that watching porn was cheating, I was so insecure, I only found out when my credit card was charged\n\nThen it was the emails and dating sites. Each incident ending in a fight, where yes, he did mess up, but I needed to be stronger emotionally. At this point I had not been on any medication. He could not cope thinking it was his fault I wasn't happy. \n\nHe eventually had to work up north a week at a time. When he came back he would be home while I worked because not everyone can work a week at a time.  We got into one of our rare fights where I told him he needed to stay and he threw me to the ground and left.\n\nFast forward to five years ago. We have been through all this through 10 years, want sure we would ever get married at this point. But we continued on.\n\nHis birthday came around and we had a threesome with a friend and he took it too far and came in her.  I wondered how stupid he could be that it took us years to get to that point that he does this with her?  I would think he could at least finish with me.\nI left and cried.  I wanted to die, but I let this happen. We ended up breaking up. I was so depressed I lost my sense of taste. I spent Christmas alone. When we were on the mend I found that my ex best friend was hanging around him.  I thought okay she has a boyfriend and i moved the town over that it was unfair of me to try and deny him comfort.  One night he told me he would call me when he got home but I never received a call. It had been snowing and I feared he had been involved in an accident. I called and called with no answer. Later that week I found that this friend of mine had slept over that night and she was telling him not to go back to me.\n\nHe says it was when he got too drunk he couldn't sleep and then fixed the curtain rod that she started seeing him as a better partner than her current bf, which she did end up leaving in the end.  She knew he was handy, dad material, good job, sweet, ect. And started flirting with him soon after he fixed the curtains.\n\nI was devastated. While I had worried about him, he was banging my ex friend. Why did I let this keep happening. Why did I want to go back to him.\nDid he help develop this anxiety.\n\nIt seemed the moment i let my guard down, my heart took another hit.\n\nIt wasn't until I accidentally came across an email where he wanted to pay for sex. It never went further than that one email. I've had it. I told him he needed help and he was going to therapy or I was done.\n\nTherapy taught him how to cope. And we were happy. We finally got married, we even have a healthy baby together. Things are good. My life is so whole now. \n\nI was blind sided when I heard this girls name at dinner. My SIL mentioned their wedding and how unique it was and I started crying.  I couldnt help it.  My eyes welled up at the dinner table while all those feelings came and slapped me in the face. While I'm living my best life.  After a childhood of dreaming of a family dinner, I'm now eating that dinner with my family and I'm sitting there stifling back my tears because I had let my guard down. I feel so much trust for my now family that I was reminded it is too good to be true, right?\n\nMy husband realized I had not properly dealt with this and offered to talk. I was so angry at the person he was before therapy but I feel so u justified to be angry because it is all in the past.\n\nI'm hurt, I'm scared, and I want to be stronger because I also have a new baby that needs me to be at my best. He's been really understanding of my feelings as he's going through an illness of his own and he is starting to realize how much I really care for him and he promises I won't have to go through any of that again.  \n\nI doubt anyone has cared to read this far but I need an outlet.\nI hope I'm not a fool in this.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T05:54:02+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T05:54:04+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/ebb2l7/am_i_a_fool_long_story_no_tldr/"}

Im really sorry if this sounds confusing.\n\nI haven't been able to cry in 10 years. Im 23 now. I purposely started to bury my emotions when I was 10. I grew up in a big family of 6 kids. My father left us when i was 2 and my stepdad came to our life when i was 11. My mom was never abusive to me or scary but I often had terrifying conflicts happening in our home during our childhood.  I don't know when but i think after I turned 13, they started treating me as I was the oldest in the family. \n\nFrom every issue they had was poured on me. Wether it was my mom and stepdad having issues, or my big brother not coming home for the night or babysitting my step brother. Relatives contacted me frequently aswell because my other siblings wouldn't answer them. So I was the guy they turned on to. When my mom often called for help, my older siblings had excuses or my mom didn't count on them because they let her down so many times. Probably most of the times they did it on purpose. \n\nI started working when I was 13 because my mom saw that I could manage myself and didn't buy any electronics anymore. But bought for everyone else.\n\n I had to give away my first big pay when I was 15 and celebrating my birthday. My little brother needed a flight ticket from africa. It was 500\u20ac.\n\n\nI didn't work until I was 17 and after a year I had saved 4500\u20ac while doing an school intern and working for 6 months. My mom told me i had to go to africa with her. I had to buy a ticket to africa and had to give away 2000\u20ac so I lost 3000\u20ac in the process. My relatives knew my mom didn't have any money and that I did so they made her ask me. \n\nSo when I came back I realized my racist manager fired me for not coming for my shifts. ( I was on a holiday leave but she altered the dates so she could fire me). So when I came back I got depressed. I turned 18 that year so I moved out. It took me 2 years to get back to work life. But it became worse. \n\n\nThey saw I could manage myself so they started asking for money. First job I took in 2 years i worked my ass off and paid all my debts and started saving.

I'm 19 years old, female, currently in university. \n\nThere are so many things wrong with me. That's how I feel, anyway. \n\nJust posting this now is a big step for me. \n\nFor a while I've been struggling myself. I know there are things wrong with me, so I try and reach out to people- my family, my friends. Every time, they are so supportive, and I feel better when I talk to them. \n\nBut just when I think that I feel better, I'll spend some time alone. It'll start to feel bad, being alone, because I worry that when I feel okay there won't be that bond between me and my family/friends anymore. So I try to reach out again, talk to them casually, talk about things not involving my sadness. I don't feel satisfied- it seems that they don't like my company that much. I try harder, but I feel worse and worse about myself. Eventually I feel sad again. And alone. \n\nI feel really sad for some time. But after some time passes, I start to realize something. The thought that I don't matter to anyone eases my anxiety about not being enough for them. Thinking that I don't exist at all, and that they don't care about me at all, makes me feel better. \n\nI wonder if this is a good coping mechanism or not. \n\nI wonder if it's okay to feel this way. I'm not hurting anyone. They don't want to be around me anyway. And if I'm content with being alone, too, then everything's okay isn't it? \n\nIs this okay? To constantly feel like I don't matter to anyone, but be okay with it? To use it as a coping mechanism?\n\nIt sounds bad, but I'm truly wondering. Because if it doesn't harm anyone then is there really a problem? \n\nIs it okay to feel this... apathetic? \n\nIt feels good to reach out and talk to people in the moment. It makes me feel better. But after that I always go back to feeling sad again. I'm worried about becoming dependent on others and feeling sad when no one has the time for me. I'm worried that I can't take care of myself, that I'm not okay by myself and I'll just keep relying on others for comfort. It doesn't seem fair to them either, for me to do that to them. So I wonder if I should just try my best to be apathetic to everything. \n\nFor me, being apathetic is thinking of myself as already dead. That my existence doesn't matter to anyone. It comforts me. I'm just so tired of feeling anxious about not being good enough for others that I think I'd rather believe no one cares for me at all. \n\nIs this... okay?", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T04:35:13+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T04:35:16+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eba8b6/apathy_as_a_coping_mechanism/"}

It was my only way to cope with external requirements. Everything was always too much, so I tried to not do things when I didn't have to. I always dutifully forced myself to do what had to be done (or to at least try), even when it caused panic attacks and very intense prolonged anxiety. \n\nOf course this way of life meant missing out on so many things that make life worth living. The things people mention when they reminisce about what really mattered, relationships with other people, shared experiences, passionate interests. \n\nI have basically never really had good friends. I had some acquaintances over the years, people I did things with, but that ended when I graduated from school. We really only spent time together because we were all outcasts anyway.\n\nI had one relationship, which in retrospect was quite the fluke. It only happened because the girl had bad self esteem and really wanted a boyfriend. I haven't even dated since that ended more than 10 years ago.\n\nIn the last few years, I've been confronted with the need to accept that certain things just aren't going to happen for me. It has slowly turned from early 30s panicked \"maybe if I hurry up and finally do some things I can still make it happen\" to \"well, I'm almost 40, it's too late and I don't know what else to aim or live for\".\n\nMy average day is still always the same. I use my energy and time to do the necessities (which in my case is work/health/chores, and then there's not enough left for much else (like hobbies, relationships, friends), certainly not enough for meaningful change. I have years and years of frustration built up due to my self isolation, and I'm not exactly sure what to do with that.\n\nWhenever I go outside and see happy couples, or just people enjoying their lives and experiencing things, it triggers my depression.

Eventually the light is so far away that it goes out completely and all that remains is the neverending descent into the hell that is depression. There is no hope, no love, no faith, and no one to grab hold to. So why do we hold on? Why do we fight? I myself have nothing left. Every night I go to sleep, i beg to a god that has already abandoned me to stop my heart in my sleep. I wish someone would save me but I am invisible. My name is meaningless, my face....forgotten. those who I once called friends and brothers abandoned me because they were being drug down into hell with me. I cannot blame them. Everyone is better off without me. Everyone I ever came in contact with was told they can do better than me. They were right. I am a man without a purpose, and without a purpose, why should i fight to live? It's not like I have very long anyways.

I have never reached out for support, or broached the topic of my mental health with another person. I go to work, exercise, eat and sleep well. I'd describe myself as pretty confident. I've contemplated suicide curiously, but never with the serious intent of doing it. \n\nThere's just one thing, I'm completely and utterly alone. As in, disappear and nobody would know alone.\n\nIn my entire life, I have never had a close friend, never been close with my parents, or never had a romantic partner. Childhood, and teenage memories never made, yada, yada, yada. Sometimes, when I have no work, I'll go days without speaking to another person. If I were to disappear the only person affected would be my manager because of the inconvenience. (That's not a piece of self pity, it's a fact as I have no close family or lover ones).\n\nBecause of this, I view relationships, close connections, close friendships etc, as sappy, and a waste of time.\n\nNow, of course this is a defense mechanism I have constructed over the years to shield myself from pity and misery. It's an easy deflection to the feelings I get when I realise it's now another year where my birthday has gone uncelebrated, or another year where I'm alone on Christmas. \n\nI'm afraid that I wont be mentally strong enough to last like this forever. Each passing year is another that I feel is lost to time. No other soul to share it with. The weight of loneliness and sadness thus gets heavier as time goes on. At the moment though I can cope.\n\nI have next to no opportunities to meet new people in my life because of the small rural area I live in. So, do I accept life as a hermit, and keep my worldview on relationships? Or what? Will I only be able to fool myself for so long, and am I missing out on what life has to offer?\n\nSo, is there any advice that you can give that could help clarify my feelings?", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T04:11:59+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T04:12:02+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb9z17/is_it_alright_to_be_alone_m23/"}

Meds are helping me feel normal and I can laugh again. My binge eating has stopped.", "author": "blue_phoenix_17", "selftext": "Realized a few months ago that I've been in the deepest pit of depression for most of my adult life. My depression was probably the worst it ever has been from 2010-2013, when I caught my (now ex) husband cheating on me with his coworker. He became verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive after that. He would make fun of my weight, call me awful names, and eventually he started using his jiu jitsu training to choke me and make me black out during arguments. (Long story why we didn't get divorced right away). Anyhow, there were a couple suicide attempts during that time, at which point the police told me to get help, or they would commit me to a psych hospital against my will. I chose to get help because if I had to live, I didn't want to lose my job, my home, and my dog. I started taking Celexa and saw a therapist. Therapy helped a lot because I also got to join the women's support group my therapist ran for abused women. The meds, however, were giving me terrible side effects like dizziness, vertigo, electrical shocks, and made my anxiety worse. With help from my doctor, I weened off of Celexa and refused to try another drug in fear of the side effects.\n\nMy depression has kind of been hiding in the background through the years since then, and I figured it would go away with time. In early 2017, I started losing weight with keto, so I felt ready for another serious relationship, met someone (seemingly) great, and I was falling in love with him. Then I had to move out of my apartment of 4-years due to a huge amount of credit card debt that I was trying to pay down, and couldn't afford to live there anymore. I moved back in with my parents temporarily in my hometown, about 45 minutes away, but I still commuted daily to work (which was very close to this guy's house). I felt pretty pathetic and like a failure because my depression made me not care about my budget and finances, which put me in that situation. A couple weeks later, the guy I had been seeing broke up with me and I was crushed. I got incredibly depressed again to the point I started writing a suicide note. I'm not sure what stopped me other than him wanting to still be friends. We did try to stay friends with him, but it was too damn hard, and I made the decision to block his phone number and on social media to get him out of my mind, and find some peace. During this time, I went from loving my job to hating it because my cool, hard-working boss quit and she was replaced by someone who is lazy and clueless.\n\nFast forward four months to February 2018, and this guy contacted me through his business page on Facebook, asking how I was. We got to taking again, and within a few weeks, we were back to fooling around and going on dates. By most definitions, we were a couple, but not officially. Then everything went to hell again when his mom died from cancer, I got pregnant, lost the baby, and he broke up with me again two weeks after telling him I miscarried. I was doubly crushed that time. I saw then what kind of person he really was because I'm not sure how cold your heart has to be to break up with a woman who just lost her baby. We tried to stay friends, then be started dating someone else under my nose a few weeks later. Watching him with his new gf on social media made my depression probably the worst it's been since the time I was separated from my husband. I cried myself to sleep almost every night, wondering what I did wrong and why I wasn't good enough. I cried in my office at work, even would break down and cry in my boss' office. I saw a therapist again, who kept telling me over and over again that being friends with him wasn't worth the pain. After giving him a thoughtful Christmas present in January this year, I didn't hear from him for 7 weeks, so I blocked him again, for good. We haven't spoken since, and he hasn't tried to reach out.\n\nMy life ever since has felt empty. I got a dog to help fill the void in my life, but she only helps so much. I still hate my job, feel like I'm underpaid and not reaching my full potential because depression and anxiety have been like a cinder block chained to my leg, and trying to drown me. I gained every bit of the 90 pounds I lost in 2017. In July, my OB/GYN lectured me about my weight gain but did nothing to help. In October, I saw my PCP, and got lectured yet again about my weight. She realized my issues go much deeper than just being a \"gluttonous pig.\" She diagnosed me with a binge eating disorder and an emotional eater, which is a dangerous combination. I agreed to try Prozac just so long as I didn't have scary side effects like I did with Celexa. That was 8 weeks ago and I feel human again. In addition, I started Wellbutrin as well, since my doctor says it will help hit those brain receptors that Prozac misses, and it helps binge eaters. \n\nTonight it's snowy in Nebraska. So I wanted to avoid driving and order delivery instead. Normally I wouldn't hesitate to order a huge Dominoes pizza, plus a pasta dish, and eat it all in one sitting. Tonight, I struggled to order food, but I knew I had to eat something. I am currently struggling to finish the pasta and a slice of pizza. So I'm hopeful meds are maybe not only improve my life, but maybe save it.\n\nTLDR; been through a lot of bad shit, heartbreak, and have been depressed for a long time.

So, what say we try them all on you at once.\" I have had a breakthrough.

For 10$ an hour. \n\nUnfortunately I didn\u2019t have a job lined up for it, and she (my former boss) is vindictive.

My earliest memory of it was in second grade. In middle school and high school I dealt with it on my own. I cut and took non prescribed medications. I was even caught with them and expelled from middle school. I went to an alternative school and I graduated out of that and was able to return to public school in high school. In high school I turned to alcohol and trying to find \"love\" in the wrong places. I ended up in an abusive relationship for a year and I finally got out of it in a brief moment of clarity. After I just barely managed to graduate I finally tried antidepressants. I was put on Prozac and added abilify and trazadone and was on it for about six months with no improvement but I felt like a shell of a person. I quit cold turkey against my doctors advice and nothing came of it. No withdrawal symptoms. Fast-forward about ten years with a marriage and two kids later. My husband and I now have a six year old and a four month old. I got diagnosed with postpartum depression (for me a worsening of my current depression) and I realized I had the same after my first that went untreated. I was now put on zoloft six weeks postpartum. It helped some to my surprise. I felt a glimmer of hope. That was until my hair started falling out in huge chunks and I had sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia). I fell deeper into a depression. I finally called the prescribing doctor and asked if maybe adding wellbutrin would help. It would work for only the sexual dysfunction but I should probably stop breastfeeding while taking both. (breastfeeding is whole other post with its emotional roller coaster) I pondered away my options whilst I was still orgasm-less and I lost more hair. I told them I wanted wellbutrin and wanted to get off of the other. I was given a tapper schedule and a schedule for increasing the wellbutrin dose. I decided to quit the zoloft cold turkey after starting wellbutrin for a week. I thought that was a great idea. After all my non doctor self thought it was very close to Prozac. I am experiencing almost all of the withdrawal symptoms. But I find it worth it as I increase my wellbutrin that is actually helping a ton. I see a light for the first time in a long and a strange hope. I could orgasm again my hair might start falling out less. The worst and intolerable symptom is brain zaps. They last all day long and are not only in my brain but a lot of times going to different parts of my body. I don't know how to manage them. Any help or similar experiences? I do know I will not be taking zoloft again. I'm keeping a medication log just for this with my experience on antidepressants. How long do all of these symptoms last?

While counselling can help some people, I feel it is less commonly used in places like the UK than somewhere like the US where it is more mainstream. Counselling helps because it adds clarity to something or allows you to tackle something head on. Medication kind of just blocks the chemicals (in the simplest terms possible).\n\nThe fact of that matter is none of them change your circumstances. People who are depressed from being lonely and isolated don\u2019t get friends and family from either solution. People don\u2019t forget their traumas. I guess my question is, how does any of it help?\n\nSure you can block the chemicals. But none of them are essentially a solution to the root problem right? What\u2019s it like to live with the problem there, knowing it exists, but theres just a magic invisible wall keeping the chemicals in balance to moderate your feeling? \n\nWhat treatment solutions have enabled you to tackle root causes head on? Especially for things like isolation and loneliness where it is not necessarily your decision to remove yourself from that situation. It is very much other people who have that choice. \n\nMoreover, how do you ever trust what you feel?

In high school I dated what people would say was the most popular and perfect boy ever. He modeled for multiple magazines, was quarterback of the football team, smartest kid in school, almost in every varsity sport by sophomore year and somehow he managed to fall in love with me despite the fact that there are so many other pretty girls at my school. When this happened everyone at school was pretty shocked bc I was basically that one girl who would spend lunch with the teacher and work on homework, aka a nerd. I was thankful for him, but I didn't date him bc he was a pretty boy, he treated me like absolute royalty. Anyways we started dating in eight grade and he asked me what one of my dreams were in life, and I told him that I'd like to qualify for the USA Junior Olympics one day, it was a pretty big dream, and I kind of said it jokingly but he replied by saying \"Okay then, I guess we'll make it happen.\" For 5 years (until my senior year of high school) my boyfriend would train me every single day for hours. He would push me non-stop and we never missed a day of training, even on holidays. I never thought I would have the potential to be anywhere near as fast to qualify for the Junior Olympics but eventually I made my way into my high school varsity track team and from there he kept helping me improve. Eventually I qualified for the National Junior Olympics Championships and was getting ready to compete in my first race. About two days before my first race, I went to the field to practice for my race and as I was running, out of nowhere, a group of girls grabbed me, took me behind the bleachers, and one of the girls took a hammer and shattered both of my knees. They ran away and after yelling in agony for a while someone eventually heard me, called 911, and I went to the ER and had surgery. I never knew why it happened until after a couple weeks of coming back to school my best friend, my absolute ride or die that I had known since second grade came up to me and said \"I have to tell you something since I feel so guilty. I knew what (insert the name of the girl who broke my knees) was going to do to you and I didn't bother telling you or trying to stop them. (The girl's name) had a crush on your boyfriend for the past 5 years and couldn't stand to see you together. She was going to poison you during lunch, but I told her to not do something so extreme so I guess she settled for breaking your knees.\" I just choked up. So much for a lifelong friend huh? I haven't been able to play any sports ever since then and can't even try out for my college sports teams. My running/sports career ended right then and there. I didn't even get to compete in my first Junior Olympic race that I had worked 5 whole years for.\n\n3. Dated another boy, we were madly on love. About a year into dating he died by overdosing on drugs. God I miss him so much.\n\n4. Got into surfing as a method of physical therapy after my knee injury. One day I stayed out surfing a little too late and I couldn't make it back to my car since it was pitch black and the flashlight on my phone didn't work. I saw a flashlight in the distance since someone seemed to be hiking on the nearby trails and shouted for help to see if the person with the flashlight could help me find my way back to my car. It was a long walk back and we made some small talk but before I knew it this guy grabbed my wrists and pulled my bikini bottoms down and raped me. \n\n5. I kind of lost hope in love at that point. I had just been through too much, but then came along this boy. I met him in class one day and we sort of clicked. We dated for a year and a half and planned so may secret trips together. We went to a different state and different country together during college without anyone knowing and would always go camping while stargazing and just talk about life. Prior to dating him I told him that I wanted to wait until marriage to have sex (since I've had a pretty traumatic past) and he said that it was fine with him and that he was willing to wait for me. I never told him I was raped btw. Anyways we would always talk about our future, how many kids we'd want, what we'd name them, how we would raise them, and he eventually gave me a promise ring saying that he would marry me in two years after we graduated (I know kind of early to be talking about this in college but we were both madly in love and had done pretty much everything together). One day I went down to my college market and sat by the counter working on an essay for class. All of a sudden I heard a student worker there talking to her friend and said \"Yeah, (insert my boyfriend's name) and I had the best sex last night. We did three rounds. One round down by the beach on the sand right next to the waves. One at the local park a few blocks down. And then we went back to his dorm and did a third round. We also went on a second date a week later and had sex in the history museum.\" My boyfriend has a very very unique name but I acted oblivious and told myself that she was talking about another guy. Then this girl said that they were planning on going on a third date on Saturday night at (insert location name). I'm not one to invade on anyone's privacy but if the guy who said he was gonna marry me was hooking up with another girl, I wanted to know. So being the idiot I am, I go to this exact place at night and lo and behold I see my boyfriend having sex with another girl out in a hidden place in public. They were having such a good time and laughing, my heart just shattered. I didn't bring it up to him until about three weeks later and he responded by saying that he was sorry and that he had no feelings for the girl at all, but that he just really wanted to have sex with someone. I was so heartbroken. How do you tell someone you're in love with them and want to marry them but then go off and do something like that? \n\nThis has all built up in my heart lately and I just needed to vent I guess. I feel so broken. I know people have it a lot worse than me but I guess it feels good to type it all out anonymously.", "created_utc": "2019-12-16T01:00:04+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-16T01:00:06+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb7pey/my_life_isnt_going_to_well/"}

I was so desperate to get out of my parents house at 26 I lived with 2 40 yr olds, one with a visiting son. The visiting son was 16, and the father, my roommate was also trying to juggle work and a dating life. \n\nSo the two 40 yr old men were part of a community of LARPERS full with costumes and weekend getaways. They played magic the gathering, watched LOTR and geeked out. Even though the son would be going along with them on these trips, there were days the adults had to leave him home. Of course, I would take the time to also play video games with the son when the adults were busy.he was a nice kid, we got along.\n\nIn my life, I was going through the worst phase of depression I experienced in my life. I was working at a place that demanded a lot from me and had treated me terribly. I was fighting with the boyfriend at the time constantly, and I tried to continue college. \n\nIt all fell apart once the semester was over. I had issues with staying late at work, and getting to class late or missing lecture entirely. I couldn't get lab work/ homework done cuz I was wiped out at the end of the day from actual work. Meanwhile I tried keeping my relationship going, and just gave up on studying to save it. The pressure I had from my parents to succeed in school, and in life in general was so intense. They also hated my living situation so it was a constant fight for approval. \n\nEnd of the year, I failed the semester, my relationship was on the rocks, and my roommates became real with me and we had a few arguments ourselves. \n\nJanuary one night, I am woken by my phone continuously going off. I am by myself in the house, and it was a Larping weekend. My roommates son killed himself. Found hanging in his mother's kitchen and the chair didnt move. \n\nNeedless to say that was a horrible night.\n\nThe funeral was amazing. I had never seen so many people before. Because, his family, friends, classmates, and the LARPING community filled the entire place. It was devastating to his father, my boyfriend, and his mother. I don't know which sight was worse, his destroyed father, or his casket. \n\nBut if only this kid spoke to someone, anyone about what he was going through.. maybe it would have saved him. Someone would have said the right thing to show that someone cared. And so many people did. He affected so many lives. And he wasn't even around to see all that love for him. \n\nI did go into a depression myself, and had believed for a few days that he had the solution. my brain had made me believe no one would come to my funeral, cuz no one would be told about it. No one would care enough. \n\nUntil I did the most loving thing for myself, and took the time to see a psychiatrist and therapist. It saved my life. Because no one could care about me more than myself. And after taking the time to give up the need for approval and the idea failure was all my fault, it helped to see the bigger picture. \n\nThere is a future. And it can be how I make it. I will find the right people to care with me. The toxic relationships and dead weight are off my shoulders.\n\nIt disheartens me to read so many suicide stories here. You have no idea who you will effect. Because even though they don't always say it of show it, there are people who care.

People my age are doing better than me. Even those who are \u201cdepressed\u201d appear to have a tough attitude to them. I\u2019m so weak and pathetic-yesterday I got jealous because my friend was able to become friends with my crush. I\u2019m freaking 26 and mentally I understand it...but emotionally I\u2019m a wreck. I don\u2019t get it. I\u2019ve taken weed, phenibut, Kratom, lsd, mushrooms, deep breathing, guided meditation and I\u2019m still this way. Emotionally inside I can feel it. I lost my friends my age because of my reputation (I always blacked out and created issues). My friends almost didn\u2019t invite me to Electric Forest because they thought I was going to be a problem (I wasn\u2019t-in fact I was the most alive and real I had ever been and in fact I caused 0 problems on drugs).\nI\u2019m not a veteran, but I did do basic and some OSUT. I feel like I can\u2019t relate to civilians nor military folk. The one person I cared about the most other than my immediate family is no longer in my life. I\u2019ve lost people to death, drugs, and because of my pathetic attempts to get EVERY. SINGLE. GIRL. This endless chase basically led me to legal issues and my ongoing depression that doesn\u2019t go away. Every time I read some self help guide, I can\u2019t help but to just see how fake it all is. I was in a pyramid scheme before so all of those self help was shoved down my throat. I can recite it back but because my dreams were destroyed by them, I can\u2019t find anything genuine anymore. I lost my dreams of becoming a music teacher-in fact I\u2019ve realized it was all a waste of time. All I do is work at a full time job that is clerical, hit the gym, smoke weed, and sometimes I\u2019ll go out (and even then I\u2019m always to the side, all awkward and shy and pathetic).\nPlease. If there\u2019s any hope, any guides anything that can help even the most stubborn-I\u2019ll take it. I want my innocence back-I want my hope to return. But now all I see is that nobody really knows what they\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re all just a fucking number.\nI failed my final semester of college because I gave up but I was allowed to walk. Sitting with everyone was a real eye opener-everyone\u2019s hammered, my family got seats behind the event but got to see it on a tv...which meant they didn\u2019t have to come out since it was all on a giant tv.

Im sure a ton of my issues stem from that my father was never around, and because of that i dont handle rejection very well\nIve always been extremely anxious in crowds and have alot of anxiety. The thing is, by nature i think im an introvert and absolutely am terrified of rejection. But on the other hand i can be the class clown and be extremely outgoing when im around friends, but not so much when im with family. Just typing this, there is so muchgoing on in.my head...its almost like i have 2 personalities. I can be extremely loving and in the same breath extremely hateful. I honestly cant figure out what my deal is. \nAnd now to top it off...my gf and i have been fighting, and when im mad, its... im right everything i do for u ...f this im outta here, i dont need this( i live with her and her 2 kids) i do everything for this lady, but i think because of my low self esteem, im extremely sensative, so i tend to take things extremely hard, especially if there negative towards me. The other day she actually said to me that i smell, not b.o. but just smell. I tried to listen to her and was thinking maybe i eat too much garlic or somethibg lol, but to be honest ever sibce she said that ive pulled back, and now have made things worse by doing erratic things such as just leaving to be by myself and now, i have spent this entire weekend in the master bedroom in this 4br house. I ve always felt comfortable living in a small space. Needless to say this has made things 10x worse with my partner. Now i just want to turn the lights off and just tunnell under the covers in my bed.

I have no life achievements to be proud of. I fail at everything I try to do, and I have no purpose. I was always an underachiever in school and that hasnt changed. In fact, I dont even go to school anymore. I decided to stay home for the semester because I found school too hard. Im weak, way too skinny (im 6 foot but weigh 145 pounds) awkwardly tall, and the ugliest person I\u2019ve ever seen.

On the 23rd of November 2019, I attempted suicide via overdose on the rooftop of my apartment. Earlier that day my two roommates and I had a discussion to see how we were all feeling about the general tone of the apartment. In the month previous, I had finally run out of money and was unable to make rent. I had solved that problem by taking a job I hated and working the graveyard shift. For context, I had recently moved to that city and was unable to find employment at all. They're both full-time students at the local college, and both work an additional \\~10 hours a week at internships, in one of their cases, his grandparents pay his rent and tuition. In this period of unemployment, I agreed to take on the majority of the housework, but as soon as I started working till 3:00 A.M. every day I became less and less reliable and willing to do my assigned duties. Our discussion about the tone of the apartment turned quickly into a \"One of us has to move out\" type discussion and they both agreed it should be me. I was given a month to find new housing. I discovered later that this was a decision they had agreed on previously, which shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did because I had woken up to them talking unkindly about me on a couple of occasions. As it stands, I got low and didn't see an out so I waited till they left for something, went to the rooftop of my apartment, and over the course of an hour downed an entire bottle of high strength Tylenol and 3 beers. A fair few folks called and texted me attempted to locate me, and I am happy they did, but I didn't respond. I called the suicide hotline after I took the pills so I could hear a friendly voice before passing out. I woke up later in the ambulance and spent 3 days in the ICU. I texted folks to let them know I'm ok a few days later. Everyone was glad I was alright, but after that, absolutely no one has attempted contact with me. Am I justified in feeling abandoned and that it might not have had that much impact if I hadn't wound up in that ambulance?

I slept from 4 am to 12 pm. As soon as I got up, I made myself some coffee and had a smoke. Then I started cleaning and I didn't stop for about 3 hours. I cleaned my kitchen and loaded my dishwasher. I started a load of clothes which is now dried, save for my jeans. I swept and mopped my kitchen floor, organized my games, wiped off and dusted my game stand and my computer table. I cleaned out my sink and wiped down my counters. I threw away a bunch of trash and walked the bags out to the dumpster. I also vacuumed my carpet and used my vacuum brush on the back of my PC, and the vents on my TV. I lit some incense and just relaxed until my son's mom dropped him off.\n\nWe spent some time together already. We played a little Final Fantasy 7, which we just started a game on together. For the gamer nerds out there, we are getting ready to blow up the 2nd reactor.\n\nThe last major thing I need to do is go and get some groceries. I tried using the walmart grocery app, but they don't have pickup on Sundays. I am really nervous about going. I have a debilitating fear of crowds. If I know I have to get groceries, I get knots in my stomach. I don't mean to sound cliche, but I hate people as a society for a number of reasons:\n\n* Loud, disruptive children.\n* Children who are buckets of disease. I have seen 5 year old boys with one hand in their pants, and the other in their nose. \n* Adults who are somehow completely oblivious to the fact that there are other people shopping with them.

I just need advice, but prepare for an extremely long post... also excuse grammar/spelling errors I'm really emotional and just have to get this out there\n\n\nIm 19, i got my dog when i was 12. I actually think im in a better place then I've ever been as far as my mental health goes, but i just don't think i can take care of my baby anymore. When i got him i was a child, i didnt understand the responsibilities that come with a dog, the care they require, any of that. I feel like i didnt sign up for this responsibilty and now i hate myself for it because it is now ME who is neglecting him then ME who will abandon him. My parents had a dog prior to this that I loved who passed away before i got my current dog. I guess he was my brothers but growing up i remember just seeing him chained up all the time cause he constantly ran away and no one walking him, i remember trying to \"set him free\"as a child.. yes I now know how horrible his treatmant was but i was a kid i didnt know. I also have compassion for my parents as they had a rough impoverished upbringing in Mexico where having a dog basically meant just feeding it and keeping it in a yard, they werent allowed to let them go inside, thats how they grew up so i dont want them to sound like horrible people, they genuinley think my current dog is well taken care of. But he's not, and i hate myself for it because hes 8 years old and my everything. I picked him out as a puppy when i was 12 a lab/border collie mix SUPER HIGH ENERGY. He was only aloud to stay outside and my dad actually fenced the yard so it provided large space for him and no chain. His lil doghouse outside i managed to get blankets, i would save money i would ask my mom to buy a snack at school lunch to get blankets/fabric at the thrift store to make his living space comfortable, i would keep his outside area clean by often picking up trash, his poop. I started brushing him everyday, bathing him once a month. Fed him and gave him water everyday, i would walk him to the park to get his vaccines(by the afforable leaque that comes yearly), id get him when he managed to get out and landed in the shelter. I love this dog, i thought i was doing great. Once he was fully grown my parents didnt let me walk him saying i couldnt control him. I was 13 and he was around 90 pounds. So he never got properly leash trained. Hes outside by himself most of the time. I said fuck that and walked anyways.. he did drag me a couple times at first but i did it anywayz. At one point i managed to walk him 2 hours everyday. Then at 16 i got a full time job and highschool, depression was it its most severe, i developed substance abuse problems, i wasnt even taking care of myself. And my poor dog just stayed out there by himself most of the time, he was fed, had a shelter, but my god that is so fucked. My parents saw nothing wrong w it. I live in a trailer in the shittier side of town and i never see anyone walk there dogs, theyre all chained w barely any space to walk, theyre not groomed, it fucks with my head that im so disgusted in myself for this but if i gave him to anyone else i doubt he would be better off and that scares the shit out of me. It was hard to find time to walk him so i did it at night. After the second time some strange man started screaming at me i was too scared to do that again. So lonely he was again. I love this dog i really do. But i cant take care of him. Its taken so much hard work to get to a point that i consistently shower, feed myself, get proper sleep that i cant handle the responsibilty of this dog and he deserves better. I still live with my parents as im not financially stable as a full time college student, with a job to live on my own. So my dog is outside 24/7, im not home most of the time, and when i am im tired, dont wanna go outside, dont want people looking at me, i dont feel like walking him and hate myself for that. This dog loves me, ive made an effort to walk him at least once a week for an hour but im starting to resent it. I dont even have the outgoing personality to walk him. I hate people that come up to talk to me constantly it gives me so much anxiety, the fucking random people that yell \"wow big dog!\" \"Is he walking you or you walking him\" i hate it so much, i hate all of it. this neighborhood is kinda shitty so MULTIPLE times walking him some dog tries to attack us cause nobody even tries to take care of there dogs here and i dont want to be like them. My dogs gotten checkups before and hes healthy, hes beautiful and extremely sweet. Hes microchipped  and up to date with his rabies shots. But ive grown up with him for these past years genuinley trying my hardest. I remember i had a similar mental breakdown last yr about this to my ex boyfriend and he said i was overreacting and hes fine? But am i? Cause reading through info online, through the doc care subreddits, im seriously neglecting him arent I? I didnt even learn that dogs were supposed to he walked everyday till last year and my parents laughed about it thinking i was being overdramaric WTF. I think my dog deserves to live out the rest of his years with someone who can keep him inside so he doesnt have to face extreme temperstures and can socialize more, he deserves to be walked everyday, he deserves someone that has more free time to spend with him, he deserves someone without depression that struggles to even take care of themself. I walked him today and it was such a struggle i dreaded going outside before i did it for hours, felt so much anxiety while i did it, and i just cant handle this for this period of my life. I really wish shelters would give a clear explanation of what the dog requires for their health before just giving them away like that. But, how fucked up and cruel is it to just give him away no? I remember one time at my exes house i brought him so he could play in his huge yard. I went back inside for an hour and i have no idea how he managed to get out of the tall wooden fence but he did, and he didnt run around the neighborhood, he just sat outside the door to my surprise seeing he was waiting there the whole time for me. He loves me how could i do this to him, but clearly im not suited for this, i wish i wouldve known sooner, hes still very energetic, he doesnt get along with dogs too well but he does with people. There's NO way i could take him to a shelter, im scared if i give him to someone else hes gonna be worst off cause people here dont take good care of there dogs at all, as in they tie them to a chain and never let them out. Ive taken him to parks, the lake, taught him some demands, ive really tried my hardest i just wish this wasnt something decided for me, but of course im still accountable for all this. Just thinking about giving him up makes me cry. And now im just a piece of shit for thinking of that but man what is the alternative? People often suggest pets to help with depression, and as an adult knowing what I know about dogs i definitley know i couldnt handle that and will not get one again tell im ready, if ever again, ive 100% learned my lesson. Im thinking a snake is more my style... But seriously i feel like im having a mental breakdown. This has happened before but i swear nobody around me cares or takes this issue seriously so i dont know what to do. I just need some input, i will value this since you guys dont know me, wont sugar coat shit, and can relate to the absolute difficulty it is to do anything with depression and why this is so hard for me.

{"id": "eb619o", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eb619o/view_of_depressive_disorders_and_symptoms_from/", "title": "View of depressive disorders and symptoms from someone in the mental health field.", "author": "MSDubbya2020", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI just wanted to say I'm glad you're here, glad you're reading this, and I hope you keep or seek treatment for depression until you find a combination that helps the most.\n\nI'm an MSW student, also an addiction counselor, and I'm finishing my degree later this year. We have to intern 20 hours a week for the duration of the full time 2 year program, and a lot of us like me also work in related fields, in my case chemical dependency. I also have an undergraduate degree in psychology.\n\nI'm NOT posting this as an expert or as advice, but rather as an invitation to see depression from my view as someone who is providing therapy for people who suffer from it in its various forms of all ages. \n\nMy heart really goes out for my clients who have depression. Therapists often talk about being able to feel it in the air with our clients, and I can relate to that. The energy levels change completely during a session with someone suffering from depression, and a lot of times you end feeling tired, why that is I don't know. Just makes me feel all the more empathetic and want to help.\n\nDepression seems like a condition that warps perceptions that are neutral into very negative ones all while sapping energy levels and a capacity for motivation and pleasure. Many of the clients I've met go through periods where they can't get out of bed, can't work, can't manage their daily routines and needs. As a therapist I worry about this and want to help the client to get back on their feet as much as can be done, at a safe pace, so that they don't suffer so long but also because often this can lead to awful consequences. People blame themselves for their exhaustion, and I don't think they should, I wish they would stop listening to the voice inside that calls them lazy, it's not laziness, it's depression.\n\nIt seems that while a growing number of people are understanding depression and mental health today, still many have convictions about it which are superstitious, based on their conception of religious teachings, some don't believe in mental health at all, and many are simply are uninformed, and this includes people suffering from depression as well as their family members.\n\nIt seems like it's the perfect storm because so often this compounds the negative self beliefs or just negative beliefs about the world that are symptoms of depression. I mean in our diagnostic books and literature and in research, it's very clear about common negative beliefs like feeling as though you're a burden, believing you are lazy, believing you are worthless, feelings of guilt that aren't fair, taking responsibility for things that aren't truly appropriate to take responsibility for, and having very unfair self expectations, among others. I hate hearing when a client who already has these thoughts in their head due to the condition they did not choose to have then hears a family member or important person say some highly misinformed or stigmatic thing about them or about depression or mental health. That's fuel for the fire.\n\nThese thoughts are intrusive, they aren't a choice as far as I can tell, just like having depression is NOT a choice, it's not because you did something wrong. This is something I hear a lot too, people take ownership for having depression and feel they earned it somehow. When I hear this, I know it is the depression telling them this, twisting perception, taking advantage of a weakness that can be exploited to make the depression worse. Everything I have read, everything I have seen, everything I've been taught does not support the notion that it's a choice or a consequence, though some things can make it worse, like alcohol use and drugs.\n\nI also don't blame people for turning to alcohol and drugs, it gives a sense of control over the emotions and state of mind, and maybe some brief relief, but of course there is a big price to pay. When clients with depression do use substances often they end up having much more severe depressive symptoms for some time afterward, and no I don't mean like a hangover.\n\nI'm personally in recovery from addiction myself and one thing about that reminds me of depression. I always felt like I had a little voice in my head that encouraged or demanded me to keep drinking, that rationalized, and that really set me up way ahead of time for relapse, like it was working behind the scenes. I eventually gave it a name and that helped me differentiate that voice, or more specifically those thoughts from my own, but it took time. \n\nI think with people who have depression there is a similar voice in there that is working behind the scenes, and I believe identifying it and segregating it might be helpful for clients in treatment. It's one thing I encourage my clients to try to do, to recognize that the core person who is you within is not the depression, that the depression is a hitch hiker along for the ride, it's not you at least that's what I believe.\n\nBeyond the negative thoughts and exhaustion are suicidal thoughts and plans and attempts and completion. I have had to do quite a  large number of suicide assessments and safety plans with clients, many who were teens but adults as well. When I'm doing this process of asking the questions, I so want that person to feel that I feel for them and that I'm there with them in the moment. It seems like many times though they are so sapped by the depression they can't even feel it, but maybe I'm wrong. Doing those assessments often leaves me wishing I could provide more. \n\nWe really do try to avoid any involuntary hospitalization, at least I do and everyone I've worked with, we always would prefer voluntary hospitalization and treatment so that the person can get through the low point safe. We know that many people do eventually get their treatment working right for them and they are glad they survived, that they did not die, and they end up living very wonderful lives largely free of the symptoms which once crippled them. That's not a fairy tale, that's real, and I wish so badly that my clients could believe it.... so badly :( I never believed I could live sober and be happy for what that's worth but here I am :) we can change and there is help.\n\nJust want to know if you are reading this that as mental health \"professionals\" we have to hold back on some things we want to say that you might want to hear, some of us say anyways in our own ways, some prefer to be more clinical. So I'll tell you that we love you, we care about you, we want you to feel better so bad, we want to help you get out of this shit, but we need your help to do it, so please ask for help... and don't give up.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T22:46:06+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T22:46:07+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb619o/view_of_depressive_disorders_and_symptoms_from/"}

My adolescence has been good and rough. My dad beat my ass sometimes and we didn\u2019t always have money.

I worked numerous part time jobs and hustled  my way through two years of community college and transferred to a good school and got a half scholarship.

I truly loved him. I never felt with any person the way I did with him, not before or since. Felt it in my soul, a peace that I can't find with anyone else or on my own. We walked away from one another because of what I will call a family feud. His family was toxic. I later realized that mine was too. The only way for us to be together would have been to leave them behind and we were both to f*cking responsible to do that. Our families needed us, in reality we were both crutches for them, but I digress...The worst part about this is that my main reason for leaving was because my sister was struggling because his brother was basically stalking her and they had some weird secret possibly abusive relationship. I don't really know exactly, just that she was falling apart and I chose to preserve her over my own happiness. In my mind I wouldn't have been able to be happy knowing she was miserable or even that my s.o.'s psycho brother could have done something to her. I lost 3 people who were close to me to domestic violence at a very young age, violent murders and it haunts me still. I wasn't willing to go through that with my own sister. \n\nIn the spirit of f*cking me over, life deals me this ironic twist about a year later: my sister suffers a seizure which caused her to be in a coma for 2 days and cost her to lose about a decade worth of memories. She didn't remember any of us, not my mom, not even her own name.\n\nSo even though all this happened a little over 10 years ago I think about it from time to time and I'm awe struck at the irony of the situation. She was the only person who knew how much I suffered for him. She and I were so close that I was willing to give him up for her and NONE OF IT MATTERS!!! she doesn't even remeber that we were ever friends. I just entered my thirties and she has the mind of a 14 year old. I lost her after all I did to try and keep her, keep us together. I lost her anyway.\n\nIt's like I can't hold on to anything. Even when I tried to pour myself into my work, I ended up losing it because I started having these crazy panic attacks and I hurt my spine...just a bunch of medical problems... Ended up homeless for a spell, after finally having a nice apartment in a nice neighborhood, dating again, and feeling like things were turning around for me. Poof. Then 2 years ago I had to give up the last thing I loved, my cat of 7 years. My last happiness. I couldnt take care of him anymore with my ailments and depression so I surrendered him to the nicest shelter I could find. \n\nI feel hopeless. I feel every failure weighing down on me, crushing me, crushing my will to go on. And the thought of my absent love burns so deeply and painfully. The loss of my sister too. She's not dead but she isnt \"here\" anymore. She's like a ghost. I see her, I interact with her, but the sister I knew is gone.\n\nPerhaps I am trying to have something I wasn't meant to.

I dont know really i just wish they wouldnt tell her about this. Probably because if i tell she will ask me how she can help but in reality no one can help cause my brains so fucked it cabt be fixed.

It\u2019s utterly ridiculous how doing what you like for 1% of your time requires you to do what you do NOT want for the remaining 99%. Even their dream job isn\u2019t gonna cut it for most people as turning a hobby into a responsibility ruins it for you and even a dream job is quickly going to become a burden as it\u2019s turned into something you have to do. Social life is also so terribly underwhelming. People never notice anything about you, they rarely say what you wanna hear. They are so quick to judge and betray. I\u2019ve barely seen the word \u201csociety\u201d ever get used in a positive context and I think there is good reason to that. People are just so mean, selfish and stupid. It\u2019s so terrifying how wanting a significant other who\u2019s actually supportive, loyal and compassionate is considered high standards. The absolute state of the human mind also doesn\u2019t help in the slightest. Most of us are biased towards negativity. Here\u2019s what I mean: sadness, hate and emberassment are all felt much more strongly and for longer than their positive counterparts which are happines, love and pride. It\u2019s like positive emotions are like an orgasm, lasting for mere seconds, while negative emotions are like an ache, lasting for hours or perhaps even days. It\u2019s outrageous how wanting a fun life of doing what you wanna do and being happy for the most of the time while being surrounded by great friends and a significant other who genuinely loves you, is considered unrealistic. It\u2019s unbelievable how living a boring life as a workaholic who has an underwhelming  social life and feels negative emotions for the most of the time, is considered normal. How can one simply say suicide is not the way when life is like this. Life is not about what we want to do, it\u2019s about what we have to do. Isn\u2019t it irrational to even want to live? Doesn\u2019t that literally make us the prisoners of our survival instinct?

And I thought I was doing a good job!  I was going to class way more often than I had in the past.  I got up, ate, and showered every day.  I made an effort to try and open up to a few people, and even though that usually didn't go well, at least I tried.  I've been trying really hard to meet a therapist or psychiatrist, but all the offices I've contacted are full, or haven't responded to my requests.  \n\nBut because I was trying, I thought I must have been improving.  I can see now I was lying to myself.\n\nDespite trying harder than I ever have in my life in succeeding in school, I'm failing at least one of my classes.  Maybe two.  I could flunk out of my major, and then I really don't know what I'd do with my life.  Not that I know what I'm doing now.\n\nI'm supposed to submit a final exam online by midnight tonight, but I just can't make my brain work.  I stare at the pages, I try to learn... and nothing happens.  I'm not used to this.  I used to be smart and absorb information, and now it's like my brain is permanently in low-power mode, performing the barest of functions needed to survive.\n\nYesterday, for the first time in my life at 20, I cut myself.  I should have realized then something was seriously wrong, but as odd as it sounds, it didn't really concern me.  I cut myself again today too.  And the most twisted thing is, I like it.  Ever since my failed suicide attempt, I realize people will be really upset if I die (even if they don't give enough a shit about me to check in when I'm alive apparently), but cutting has given me that aspect of control back over my life.\n\nSo yea, I could really use someone to snap me the fuck out of whatever is happening.  None of my friends will do it.  Apparently I'm not high enough of a priority for a licensed professional to meet with me and do it.

It happens so often it's actually kind of pathetically hilarious at this point. I've always considered myself quiet but not mousey, I never thought my voice was particularly quiet. Apparently it is, either that or people just really have no interest in what I have to say. Friday night I was speaking to one of the directors for the company I work for. I literally watched this man lose interest as his eye wandered around the restaurant until he settled on someone he thought was and old friend. He then walked away to go talk to this other person (who wasn't who he thought he was btw) while I was still in the middle of my sentence. Yesterday, one of the waitresses came up to me and started talking. I let her say her piece, and then I started to say mine. Again, just walked away in the middle of my sentence like I wasn't even talking. I could understand not hearing me but come on really? My lips were still moving! You knew I was still talking! We'll be standing together in a group; me, my 2 coworkers, and my supervisor. Every time I open my mouth and start a thought, I get cut off. Hell, again yesterday I was actually having a conversation with my supervisor and one of my coworkers came up to us, stuck his hand out at me and said \"excuse me\", and started a different conversation with my manager right in the middle of me finishing mine!! It wasn't like he cut me off because he had a work related question. No, he just genuinely thought his topic of conversation was that much more important than mine. Growing up, my grandpa would cut us off if he thought of anything to say in that moment because he thought what he had to say was more important that what any of the women had to say, so me, my mom, and my grandma are all pretty used to being cut off and ignored in conversation. Much more so for me because my mom has also picked up on that habit and has cut me off from speaking since I was a girl. Even my boyfriend has the same habit of blurting out whatever thought or topic of conversation comes to his head, regardless if you're finished talking or not. I have a cousin who's a f**king saint when it comes to letting me speak. If someone cuts me off when we're talking, she'll never break eye contact with me. She'll let the person speak and redirect the conversation right back to me so I can actually get ALL of my thoughts across. I've never really thought I was boring, and those who have actually bothered to get to know me say I'm good company, but it's so embarrassing getting cut off/ignored the way I do. It's gotten so bad over these past few months that I've started just writing all my thoughts down to get them out one way or another. I'll let people talk to me and I'll give just bare bones basic responses so if they walk away again I don't feel like an idiot for daring to conversate. I try testing the waters every now and then but as you can see people still just love to ignore me so we're going back to silence starting today. I'm tired of everyone asking me why I'm so quiet and reserved nowadays. Maybe take a step back and think about what made me this way. I'm sorry for ranting, but its getting so tiresome never being able to complete a thought. It hurts feeling like everything you say just falls on deaf ears.

I\u2019m always first to find her and help her but I feel like I\u2019m not getting the same support back. How do I express how it feels like to be me, to a person whos clueless? how do I explain my depression in words she will understand?

Nothing will be brought up by me that is not related to the work. I'll spend every coffee break staring at Reddit, playing Minecraft on smartphone and sipping coffee.

Then he starts telling me what I should do  differently with the stew next time I make it. And to be honest, I don\u2019t recall him ever saying thank you for me making it all. Not to mention we had important plans that he cancelled this morning, as usual. So forgive me if I\u2019m not in the mood to hear him criticize anything I do right now. Then he tells me I should make mashed potatoes out of the red potatoes I put in the stew. Which I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve never made mashed potatoes out of red ones before. Only russet potatoes. Then he starts yelling about how they\u2019re all the same and how he wants skin left on them, cause I peel them. I say I don\u2019t like them that way and he then he says he doesn\u2019t know why I \u201cinsist on bit**ing about it.\u201d And makes a few other nitpick remarks about it. \n\nI was also thinking of giving some to a friend who may have bronchitis, but then I remembered he also doesn\u2019t like it when I give other people food. You know, people who are going through tough times and could use it? Or just out of kindness? He\u2019s literally guilt tripped me out of it a couple times. He\u2019s been all like, \u201cDon\u2019t give away MY food that I paid for!\u201d \n\nSo basically I take the time to put together a nice dinner and this is what I get in return. Not only did he eat practically all of it in a short period of time, and left barely any for me, but then he COMPLAINS about it! And I get called the bit** for not wanting to make more. Literally he got mad at the fact I didn\u2019t wanna make more mashed potatoes right at this moment, like they don\u2019t take any time at all. I don\u2019t feel like doing it and I don\u2019t wanna hear it. I\u2019m too freaking irritated right now, and I know he\u2019s not gonna care.

Until recently, I've had a relatively normal relationship with food but always had to be careful of what I eat because I gain weight very easily.\n\nAfter a few setbacks with my mental health recently, I've turned to food to make me feel better and I've gained 10 kg. This is on top of steadily gaining weight over the past two years so now I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I wouldn't say I'm binging as such as I used too, but if I'm alone and having a bad day I will sit and eat large bars of chocolate, or McDonald's etc but it's all in the mindset to try make myself feel better. How do I stop these feelings and try not turn to food so much?\n\nThe weight gain itself is making me feel really bad about myself. I feel really unattractive to my boyfriend and feel like he's not as sexually attracted to me anymore. My self esteem is really low which isn't helping my mood in general. I just feel so greedy and out of control. \n\nI've recently started anti depressants so perhaps that's a factor too. I do go to the gym and swimming but find it hard keeping a routine with exercise because of my job and the medications I'm on can often make me feel a bit too dizzy at times to really work hard at the gym.

So, if you manage to read this whole thing, thank you.\n\nSo, I have this really bad habit of just bottling everything up and refusing to address any of it. I tell myself, it isn't a big deal, I don't need to burden anyone with my silly problems.\n\n But I've been a fairly heavy drinker since I was about 19. I went through a pretty nasty relationship. He was an alcoholic and to escape the abuse the best way I could, was to also drink. I'm now 26. I went through a lot of crazy shit to get to where I am now. I'd like to say that I'm doing better, and I am in a lot of ways. I'm not self destructing but I've merely just turned into a functioning alcoholic. I only drink a few times a week but I have to do it or I'm miserable. I tell everyone I'm doing it for fun, this is my way of unwinding. It really isn't. They buy it of course. Why wouldn't they? I guess I do a good job of fooling everyone, but my depression tells me it's just because they don't care enough to see it any other way. So it's easier to just believe the lie, I guess.\n\nI also need to drink to cry. I need it to let out all of those things I bottle up so tightly. When I'm sober, it's so hard for me to let out any emotion, besides anger. It's fairly easy for me to be angry when I'm sober. That emotion is also stronger when I'm drunk. So I turn into this crying, insane, angry mess. I just let it all out. I always feel so much better afterwards. I'm highly aware of how unhealthy it is. I've looked into plenty of coping mechanisms. Gym, read, write, go for a walk, crafting. All that stuff is great. I just don't have the energy and motivation to do it half the time. That makes me angry. Like, come on I really want to do something productive. Instead I stay in bed and just feel sorry for myself and hate myself even more. Everything is a chore. Bathing, eating, going to doctors appointments. Except for drinking. I'm always motivated to do that. I like the way I feel when I'm drunk. I'm social, it gets me out of the house (because I go to the bar) I can let out my emotions. I know it's unhealthy. I know I need help.

I am so depressed here as it is with my job and this city, I had an awful week last week and I had a massive breakdown. All I was looking forward to was my mom visiting and just getting to spend time with her. December is the only time of year I get two days off in a row too, so I was happy to have the time. \n\nOn the way here her car started to act weird so she had to turn home and it died. My mom has MS and it was already big she was trying to make it out even though it was late in the day when she could come. I\u2019m just so sad that she couldn\u2019t make it here. I had ordered pizza for us to be ready when she got here since it would be quite late. So instead of hanging out with my mom I have spent my time in my room, eating this pizza I couldn\u2019t actually afford but wanted to do something nice, listening to my roomate and her mom had a good time and do whatever stuff hanging out around the house having a good mother daughter time. \n\n\nThis is literally just a drop in the bucket at this point, my mom is literally the most important person in my life and I don\u2019t get much time with her.

I need this part of my life to be over because nothing is going even okay. I just can\u2019t stand it. I couldn\u2019t even have the relief of spending time with my mom after everything.

I was forced to drop a course (for personal reasons), my grandfather died and I had to fly out for his funeral. I had three (four, but I had to drop a course) finals that week, and I was forced to do one of them on the plane and defer another one. I didn\u2019t do too great on any of them. Two days after I got back I was in a car crash with my girlfriend, in my mother\u2019s car. It is going to cost me my life savings, (re: roughly 6k increase a year for insurance because the guy wouldn\u2019t accept a cash payment for damages), and I\u2019m pretty sure she hates me now. To top it off, I haven\u2019t been able to go to the gym in almost a month and a half because of school, and since I have a habit of stress eating, I\u2019ve gained almost thirty pounds and I\u2019m starting to see stress marks. \n\nTl;dr: In the first two weeks of December 2019, I may have broken my relationship, wasted all my money, got fat, didn\u2019t get the grades I wanted, crashed someone else\u2019s car and lost my grandfather.

I have had so many of them that I thought this was normal. Anyways, whenever I bitch about myself, the biggest advice I get is to just put myself out there. I failed...miserably. \n\nI tried. I really tried. I don't think I can do this.\n\nThis is for both seeking friends and romance. I always heard I had to put myself out there for either, but I have no idea what to do once that happens. \n\nSo, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). Yup, I'm THAT loser.\n\nWell...I tried \"just putting myself out there\". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. \n\nSo one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just \"come out of my shell\". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. \n\nI was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.\n\nAlso I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. \n\nAlso physically I felt insignificant. I am 5'8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). \n\nSo yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. \n\nSo yeah. Here I am, back in my shell wrapped in a blanket alone in my room. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.\n\nSorry for getting melodramatic. \n\nTl;dr I tried socializing and it didn't work out and ended feeling lonelier.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T19:24:14+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T19:24:15+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb3a71/i_tried_putting_myself_out_there_and_failed/"}

Currently life reduced to ashes.", "author": "adowjn", "selftext": "TL;DR: Was previously really ambitious. Currently I have energy for absolutely nothing and feel like my life is done.\n\nCurrently 28. Got an engineering background and worked for around 3 years in the field. Also spent some time abroad working. During university I started taking Escitalopram 20mg for generalized anxiety and depression due to a breakdown. Considered taking a time off from university but Escitalopram ended up solving everything - anxiety vanished and I felt like a big weight was taken off of my shoulders. I kept pushing; was even more motivated to go on than before. I kept taking my pills for years and everything was pretty much fine - I didn't become the most social person in the world with Escitalopram but anxiety and depression were manageable. After around 5 years of taking it I started to slowly tapper it down, for around 1 year. I chose to go really slowly as I had tried to quit fast before and those were quite bad experiences. When I was already down to 2.5mg, a lot in my life changed - ended a 1-year relationship, moved back to my parents, and also started working as a freelancer remotely, so a lot of solitude involed. This was back in April. I was already at such a low dose of Escitalopram that I said fuck it, and also dropped the meds - saw it as a whole new start.\n\nWas fine-ish for a month or 2. Then crippling anxiety and panic started to creep in. The type of panic I thought I would never get to experience - at times I just wanted to get out of my body. I started having suicidal ideations then. Also started having severe digestion problems. I was being followed by a psychologist who I had been with for around 2 years. During our sessions we agreed that this would just take some time to adjust and go back to normal, as my brain was getting used to function without the SSRI. The anxiety and panic didn't start dimishing though, they were only increasing. I got into a downward spiral. I also started worrying a lot about my digestion problems as I wasn't being able to digest anything properly and all my appetite disappeared - which further increased my anxiety and panic. This made me go to a lot of medical appointments and exams, from which nothing wrong was found in my digestive system. They just told me it was caused by anxiety. I accepted it after having a clean endoscopy and colonoscopy and made an appointment with a psychiatrist to treat the anxiety. I also stopped working because I just wasn't being able to function with the severe panic and repetitive thoughts about the digestive issues. \n\nTried a course of several different SSRI's but nothing seems to work like it did back when I first started Escitalopram. I've tried Fluvoxamine, Mirtazapine, and currently I'm on Escitalopram again (around 3 weeks on 10mg and for 2 weeks on 20mg). While I was on Mirtazapine (and also on Bromazepam) I started feeling really tired and achy, like I had the flu and having headaches  (even though I was only on 7.5mg Mirtazapine). I went thorugh some bloodwork tests and they found that my liver enzimes were quite high and likely those meds were to blame (this was around 2/3 months ago). After I stopped them, my liver enzimes went back to normal, but the original syptoms I had didn't, which made my anxiety skyrocket again. Also started having muscle twitches all over my body and waking up feeling completely drained. Also some days I felt a burning sensation in my arms and legs. Started worrying about a potential neurological disease such as MS, and started having repetitive suicidal thoughts as I didn't want to go through such a terrible disease. My suicidal ideation grew so strong I had to ask my parents to check me in at the hospital, otherwise I would soon act on it. Spent 9 days at the hospital. Doctors tell me the symptoms I have are either psychosomatic or side effects of the medication, but this still isn't enough to quell my distress - I'm currently really, really depressed about the fact that I might have something, although the Escitalopram seems to have made the anxiety vanish. Even the thought of it being something non-life threatening such as fibromyalgia scares me to death as I don't want to live my life feeling like I am debilitated and, as I see it now, would rather die. Anyone went through similar symptoms and it turned out to be nothing?\n\nSummarizing: I'm 28, living with my parents, no job or any interest to get one, no energy to do anything, no SO, and afraid to have a debilitating disease.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T18:54:50+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T18:54:52+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb2vw1/thought_id_achieve_it_all_and_be_happy_currently/"}

I am a SAHM after a 20+ year career I just recently left to raise my small kids. My husband and my kids are my life. I feel like I do everything for them and little to none for myself. One condition of leaving my job was I was going to be solely responsible for the kids. Getting them to school, picking up, snack, dinner, bedtime, the whole nine yards and the second condition was I was to effectively run the house with cleaning , laundry and such. I feel like this is the role I was born for and I love it.  I also feel I do a good job with the exception of a sink full of dishes now and then and  a messy living room while the kids are playing. So yesterday my husband and I got in a fight and he told me he and my kids deserve better than me. That sentence crushed me. I suffer from depression and he knows it. I also suffer from suicidal thought and he knows that as well.  Last night I took 27 Xanax (that\u2019s all I had) hoping I didn\u2019t wake up in the morning. Obviously it didn\u2019t work. I am so depressed right now and hurt and just don\u2019t even want to live anymore. I know this is not normal.

Usually I do spent a lot of time outside, but only at nighttime and by myself. Yesterday I went into the city and decided I would try to speak to girls. It was really hard and I didn't have the courage to speak because most of the girls were with their friends. I roamed around the city for 2-3 hours trying to just do it.. But it was hard because the girls I saw walking around by themselves walked past me very fast, and I didn't want to be like a creep and go back to catch up. \nAt the end of the day I was at the bus station and saw a girl, not that I was attracted to her or whatever but I know myself, and I would be pissed if I went home having talked to no one. I walked past her to see when my bus was coming and afterwards stopped thinking and was like man fuck it. I went over and said something along the lines of \" Hey I just saw you and knowing myself, I'd regret not coming to talk to you and introduce myself. My name is.., and what is yours?\" We shaked hands and exchanged names, but her responses were dry, she never asked me something and I had to tell her by myself we are from the same country etc. But she had a little smile (maybe because she was laughing at me) and she didn't seem nervous or threatened or whatever, just not interested.. I am mad at myself because it got weird when I asked her her age, she was 25 and I am just 20. Obviously the age gap made me reconsider and we simply stopped talking and I turned around acting like someone called me because I was embarrased. I walked to the next bus station and she literally was in the same bus, so embarrissing!! She laughed at her phone when she saw me getting in, like when she texted her friends about it because it was so funny to her or whatever. I never seen this girl before and we got off the same stop, I fear we know similar people and she tells many this story or maybe even took a picture of me when I turned around and people will recognize me or whatever. Thats me overthinking. \nLooking back, I should've just closed the conversation like \"Alright. Well I gotta go, have a good one\" but I simply stopped talking like the awkward stupid man I am. Also, I should've been more confident but it is so hard for me to be with my depression, she probably realized I had no confidence. We only talked for a minute and my mind is like \"See? U coulnd't even get her to like you. You are from the same city and she will tell everyone about it, she even laughed at you while typing to others about that encounter\"\nBut at least I went out my comfort zone, whatever the consequences may be I don't regret going against my self hating brain. It was my first time talking to a girl which I saw for the first time, with girls I know I am very relaxed and more confident, but in that situation I was more kind of nervous. Maybe I'll do it again.. maybe I won't. \n\nThanks for reading, these kind of things are always in my mind and I just wanted to get my story out there because I have no one else to talk to. Maybe I am just looking for someone saying I did good trying..", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T18:01:32+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T18:01:33+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb26ao/going_out_of_my_comfort_zone/"}

I don't recognize who I am anymore, and I don't think I'll ever get back who I used to be. I was so happy and so nice. I think that's why I'm taking this so hard. I was such a sweet optimistic person and now I just don't want to deal with my feelings anymore. They're overwhelming. When I feel good, I feel good. I laugh, smile, and enjoy myself. I *almost* feel normal again. I used to feel normal during the good times, but now I feel a little less happy/like myself when things aren't bad. When I start to feel bad I want to die and I get so sad it hurts. I don't even have the energy to make my life better. I won't let my boyfriend break up with me, even though the relationship has only been getting worse and worse. He cheated, he's so mean sometimes, and I've put so much love and care into him and this relationship. I tried so hard when he opened up about his depression. I adopted a realistic mindset that he's changed and I can't change him back, I tried to make things easier for him, I tried to show him I was here so he wouldn't worry about being left alone. Now that my depression has gotten worse, he has problems even hugging me when I'm crying/sad. He has called it annoying and insinuated that I'm the one making myself this sad. But why would I want to feel so bad that I'd want to be dead? I miss how things were before. I miss the old me. I cry for her constantly. Looking at old pictures of me genuinely smiling makes me tear up because I miss that. I'm starting to think I am doing this to myself though. Sometimes it feels like I like to be sad because I have so many opportunities to change this. I have friends I don't talk to anymore, I have people who want to hang out, I have access to therapy, I could set up an appointment for antidepressants, I could leave him (he has asked me to several times), I have family, my life is good. Why am I doing this to myself? Every time I do something that's good for me I feel better. So why am I laying in a bed for hours and starting arguments with my partner? Is he really being mean, or am I being irrational? Am I really depressed or am I making things bad for myself? I feel crazy. I can't tell what I'm warping with my perception anymore.\n\nIf you guys knew me personally before all of this, you would've been shocked. The personality change is so dramatic that it's actually sad. I was genuinely such a sweet, grateful, kind-hearted person. I used to think about how I wouldn't mind dying because my life had genuinely been so rewarding and fortunate. It felt like a gift that I was lucky enough to experience.

This is the first time I actually post a story  to anything and I don't actually know where to post it but this feels semi appropriate.\n\nBasically I'm 18 years old and my bf is 21. We've been together for about 5 months and we live about 3 hours away from each other. I spend a lot of time with him. A large chunk of each month I live at his house which is kind of nice but I miss my dog and horses and family. I also suffer from near crippling depression and am on a strong dose of antidepressants. \n\nSometimes I forget my meds and he gets mad about it because I'm not acting happy or I'm a bit extra sensitive. Jokes about being tired and when I say \"same\" he gets mad and says I've done nothing all day to deserve to feel tired. \n\nWhen I get upset about him saying this he apologises and acts as if it was all just a joke and I'm acting unfair and taking everything so seriously. Like wtf bro.\n\nI decided to spend about two or three weeks at home and then spend New Years at his place. He wants to come visit over the weekends which is nice but it's a 3 hour drive at least and then it's only really 24 hours together. Which is nice, sure, but still. In my opinion it's not a big deal to spend a couple of weeks apart (the internet has been invented if I'm not wrong, we can Skype and text and stuff like that) but he feels like it's too much. He's always texting me with stuff he knows means nothing to me. A good morning and a small chat before work is enough for me tbh. Then all throughout the day he's sending me random snaps and then calls me like 15 times in the evening even though I've told him that evening that I'm not feeling too well and don't really have the mental energy to talk. And he takes it personally and gets upset. Am I the only one? \n\nSorry for the rant. Needed to vent, can't do it to my mom because she'd lose it and give me a big speech telling me indirectly to break up with him but when I confront her about it she denies it and acts as if I'm crazy. She really cares about him too. And I love him.... but apparently my love for him is not enough. He needs all my energy and time as well. Even when we (family on the farm) have a sick horse that requires near constant care. Thanks babe.

I have always been an extremely skinny guy and that is an emotional and physical burden that I have been dragging throughout my life. At the beginning of this year I was weighing 115 pounds because I was going to a gym and for some reason, my gastritis didn't bother me for a while. Months later, I was fired from my job, which had me under a lot of stress. After I got fired from that shitty job, I started again with the gastrointestinal problems that I have suffered throughout my life. These symptoms are nausea, difficulty defecating and gastritis. These discomforts cause me sadness and too much anxiety when going out or eating.\nUnfortunately I locked myself back at home as I used to do before I had the job. (Since I was 14 or 15 years old tbh) I have to clarify that I have always been a very lonely person and today at 24 years old, I can say that I am a virgin and I have never kissed a woman. Many would think that it is due to an inability to talk to women or something like that but that hasn't been the case all these years. Actually, several women have told me that I am a very intelligent and talented person in artistic disciplines. That I am one of the most interesting people they have ever met but usually these women also have their own burdens and shit. I have never liked such words or compliments because defining what intelligence is is very difficult in my opinion.\n\n\n I know that I have talent as a songwriter and the truth is, at the end of the day, today my most sacred shelters are music and books. Maybe today I would have the opportunity to have a girlfriend or friends but I no longer feel too much bond with people in general. I could have a beautiful woman physically in front of me and I will not think that it is the eighth wonder of the world or anything like that. For me it is just another human being existing in this shitty world. I could have a very cool and interesting woman and still prefer to be alone because I know that people are only temporary and I could never open up to someone who would later know all my secrets or deeper thoughts and then go away. I am no longer interested in making friends whether or not they are interesting people and women, inside, no longer attract my attention because I feel I cannot communicate deeply with them. I can make them laugh and make them feel comfortable and feel heard and understood but inside, I end up getting bored and feeling dissatisfied with people.\nThe only people I love are my parents, my sister and my beautiful chihuahua.\nNot having a girlfriend or close friends affected me in the early part of my adolescence. It caused me a lot of sadness along with anxiety. This intensified when I decided at age 15 not to go to school anymore and study from home. Interestingly, today I have had the offer or the opportunity to kiss women and I have not taken the opportunity. It is no longer something that excites me. \nIronically I have received oral sex from a girl but I didn't find it to be anything out of this world. It seems that sexual desire has also been decreasing considerably over the years and today I find more pleasure in masturbating at night when I am stressed while watching a porn video.\nAs I mentioned before, I am 24 years old and I went from weighing 115 pounds to 99 pounds due to these stomach symptoms that I have suffered throughout my life and that calm down for seasons as well as anxiety. I have always had problems eating that are mixed with anxiety. Lately, I have been thinking about the time food is in my stomach in case I throw up, I don't vomit too much. There are years when I can go to any restaurant and eat without thinking about anything, just enjoy and other times when thinking about going to a restaurant causes me an attack of horrible anxiety and many nausea. I have some degree of emetophobia and you can imagine how much my anxiety intensifies with this discomfort every time I get in a crisis. 4 months ago I started with nausea and difficulties to go to the bathroom again. I locked myself up again and because of the discomfort of these symptoms I couldn't eat anything because I wanted to throw up. \nThey gave me horrible stomach ache and I see myself in the mirror looking like a fucking corpse.\nI went to the doctor and after seeing poop test results, he told me that I have an inflamed intestine and gastritis due to anxiety again or a lot of stress. He has given me medication and I only calm down for a few days. Then, I return to where I was before. He says depression, anxiety, gastritis and irritable bowel are somehow connected. \n\nYesterday my sister had her wedding and I was forced to go. Everything was going more or less normal until it was time to eat. I tried to eat and it made me nauseous and the nausea caused me anxiety attack. Actually, I think I had some anxiety before arriving. Halfway through the wedding, I went to the bathroom and my nose began to bleed for no reason. My eyes were red. I returned to the table and asked for the food to be given to me to take it home with me. My sister got angry and called me weak ass asshole and that I was just crazy and weak. Other people, apart from observing my extreme thinness, judged the fact that I was the only one who didn't eat at the table. On the way back, I almost cried but I was driving with my mother in the car and I couldn't park to cry. However, I did tell her how bad I felt. She understood me and gave me some comfort. I love her.\n\nTo be honest with you, I am already tired and I have reached a point where I can no longer stand going out and see how people stare at me for being too skinny or feeling stomach upset from the anxiety itself. Maybe it's my imagination or maybe those people don't even notice how thin I am. Maybe they don't even care but I feel terrible and I feel like a walking corpse. \nI can't stand these anxiety attacks, this existential emptiness and this lack of energy in my body anymore. Just as I can not stand nausea and visits to the doctor and being under medication. I would like to end this life once and for all but at the same time I don't have the courage to do it. Nor would I want to end my life since I want to record many of the songs that I have composed but I see more and more and more impossible the fact of fulfilling the goal of recording the songs and feeling calm for at least once in my life. Last time I felt happy was when I was 13 or 14.\nMusic is not cheap to produce and I don't even have a damn computer because in my third world country, everything is sold very expensive.\n\nAs I said before, I am not a person who opens up to others telling my problems because I have built a kind of bubble around where I want to remain in total mystery and anonymity in front of people. I don't want anyone to know anything about me, so telling all this on a social network like Reddit comforts me a bit and takes away the pressure of you guys knowing who I am or what my identity is; I can hide behind an alias. Even in music it is difficult for me to express myself with words since I feel quite exposed and usually my feelings are reflected in the melodies that end up being quite dissonant and quite dark.\n\nAnyway, there are more things but it would be eternal to tell everything here in one post. Thanks to those who have read until the end. It has calmed me a little to get this out of my chest and know that someone reads me even for once in my life and feeling comfortable at the same time. \n\nPS: sorry for my spelling mistakes or grammar mistakes. English is not my native language.\n\nBe safe, guys.\nLove.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T16:15:57+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T16:15:58+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb0r6c/my_sister_got_married_yesterday_while_i_was_in/"}

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the long distance aspect was killing me (I'd been sent to hospital for how intense my panic attacks were getting and I had no idea what was causing them). I'm having to drop out of university because I got fucked over by a company I worked for not paying me or giving me shifts for two months, meaning I've been deprived of food for that entire time. I managed to get back in contact with my ex and we spoke about going on a date to give us another try, and then yesterday I found out one of my \"closest friends\" was trying to get with her and invited her round the other night. Since I could remember I've been massively fucked up mentally thanks to the neglectence of my family, and various abusive relationships I've been in. So usually the only source of enthusiasm I find for living comes romantically, but now I feel that has left as not only have I been betrayed by a friend who knew what they were doing would hurt me a lot, I have lost my last chance at having an anchor that makes life worth living.\n\nI've tried to overdose 4 times in the last 3 months and my parents thought making me an alcoholic would be a good laugh, so I also have drinking as a very destructive coping mechanism. I'm considering dropping my job to sit in a drunk bliss of sadness for the next few weeks before I move again.\n\nI'm just so lost and I don't know if life is worth the effort of going forwards any more, I find more ways to punish and harm myself with every speed bump I come across and I don't think I can take much more.

I know it's a lot to ask, but don't let me die for nothing. I'm dying to help you be happy. To live a full and happy life that doesn't include me. With all that said, I'm sorry.

First off, I don't have a great relationship with my family; I was bullied by them and my teachers and peers growing up and now in middle age I'm extremely self-conscious and shy. Everyone around me seems to have normal families and normal friends except me.\n\nGetting back to the therapy piece, I was married to an older, abusive man for a decade who snored like a bandsaw, and as a result had bad insomnia. I was told I needed a psychiatry consult to get on klonopin to help me sleep as nothing else was working. The guy I saw practically smirked at me as I sat there tearful, and when he asked me what I wanted to do with my life I said \"I just want to quit my job and travel the world\", to which he replied, \"Well, why don't you just grow some dreadlocks then?\" Then the prick told me to \"just try to be happy\", recommended a book and a therapist, and wrote in my office visit note about how I looked \"professional\" (another reason I'm never taken seriously; how can a professional-looking woman possibly be depressed?? I know right? /rolls eyes) then my insurance was charged $600.\n\nAbout 7 years before that I fell into a deep depression, lost weight because I was terrified to swallow food, thinking I was going to choke on everything I put in my mouth. In my intake I wrote that I had suicidal ideation and about my weight loss. The counselor asked me why I was there and after I talked for about three minutes told me, \"Most of my patients keep more to themselves at their first visit\" and then something about how I was talking too much. Then in talking more she asked me my profession; I replied that I was a dietitian to which she responded, \"I don't believe in diets\" (which had nothing to do with my job anyway) and continued to tell me for about ten minutes that she went to a holistic nutritionist who diagnosed her with vitamin C deficiency just by looking at her hands. Then she told me that I was just depressed about my job and needed to think about becoming a holistic nutritionist. She was actually referred to me by my employee assistance program at work. \n\nDon't even get me started on the last therapist I saw. They all just seem so judgy and SMUG, especially if you've ever fucked up in life and then they are judge and jury. Anyway, I just gave up and now my attitude is that therapists just get to do whatever they want, backed by a license, as long as they don't do anything too egregious and get caught. I'm very cynical. The blanket attitude of health care is \"you have depression? Then why aren't you seeing a therapist?\" along with tons of judgment about people with mental illness (including keeping people from getting care they need because of the idea that they can't care for themselves or something), despite this idea that we should all be wearing our feelings on our sleeves. \n\nThis is mostly just a rant, but I'd feel better knowing others have been through this kind of thing too.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T15:46:27+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T15:46:28+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb0e7n/therapy_is_disappointing_and_im_slogging_through/"}

He's very quiet and doesn't engage in much of a conversation. I'm in my second year at university and we are neighbors in our block of flats on campus. I know a lot about social anxiety and I don't think he has social anxiety because he does not avoid things and doesn't get hot/sweaty etc, and he can become argumentive...\n\nWhen he does engage, it usually comes across as rude and even critical. In fact, the more I've thought about it, the more it comes apparent to me that when we talk he is only criticizing me or even being rude or being hostile.\n\nFor example, whenever I made a mistake, he will comment on it. I'm a very positive person and even when I've complimented him, he's looked at the issues.\n\nFor example, in a presentation we did as a team recently, he barely added anything to the powerpoint slides in the prep. He only looked over my shoulder and whenever I made a typo, he would quickly comment on it. It doesn't feel much of a friendship, but more of a nasty shadow over me at the moment. I added a ton of details to the powerpoint and made it look nice with GIFs. Unfortunately, there was a slight error during the presentation with the GIFs seemingly lagging the presentation - my friend smartly thought of a solution that fixed it during the presentation. I complimented him for this, for his quick thinking. I thought it is good to compliment someone who is quiet and thought of a good solution.\n\nBut after afterward me complimenting him, he would go start to on about my GIFs and \"no thanks to you...all those GIFs...\" (this was not done or said in a jokey way or manner, it felt very rude and hostile.. I'm very confused; when you compliment someone for doing someone thing.\n\nEarlier today, I was upset over something and spoke to him, and he sided with a complete stranger by saying \"yeah, you should be sorry and then XYZ..\"\n\nI'm trying to work out the person in front of me.\n\nIs it possible he has a specific type of social personality? I would struggle to ask him such a question because a) I don't want to come across as rude b) I do not know pretty much anything about him on a personal level since he keeps to himself a lot...\n\nThank you for your support in advance\n\nKind regards,\n\nDom", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T15:42:08+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T15:42:10+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eb0cge/understanding_my_friend_advice_to_help_me_better/"}

Wasn\u2019t that I don\u2019t like them, it was just the fact that I grew up verbally and physically abused at home and school. I didn\u2019t want to raise a kid knowing that I never had a role model and I didn\u2019t wanna screw up another generation. My mentality has changed so that I can only recharge when I\u2019m alone. My wife gave me an ultimatum 9 years ago: \u201cEither we have kids or I\u2019m gone.\u201d So, fast forward to today and we have a 7-yr-old. I love my boy and wife, but they are my anxiety personified. My son is disrespectful to me, and my wife is emotionally controlling and abusive. His disrespectfulness is a direct result of my wife not allowing me to discipline him. Whenever I try, she always thinks I\u2019m \u201cangry\u201d and tells me to leave the situation. Because of this, my son rules the household. He is also INCAPABLE of doing anything on his own now. He won\u2019t go to the bathroom on his own, get his own snacks/drinks, or play by himself. I hate playing with toys btw. If I try to correct this, my wife instantly comes down on me as being mean to him. Basically, we can never get a break. On top of that, I cherish silence. If there\u2019s constant noise, it triggers my anxiety and irritability. My son never shuts up. He is always talking and very loud. I am now at the point where I dread being at home. I absolutely HATE WEEKENDS! I\u2019m constantly told by everyone that I\u2019m a \u201cgreat dad and husband\u201d but I sure don\u2019t feel it. I guess it\u2019s easy for people to see you as great when you\u2019re constantly just doing what you\u2019re told because there\u2019s no other option. I am in therapy and on meds, as well as having resorted to opioid addiction so I can fake happiness, but as I told my doc nothing is helping. I don\u2019t wanna commit suicide, but I really don\u2019t give a shit if I die. I\u2019ve actually prayed for it. I\u2019m tired of everyone always thinking I\u2019m in a bad mood and trying to get me to change, especially my wife who\u2019s supposed to be understanding and supportive. Of course I\u2019m on a bad mood, I\u2019m fucking miserable because my voice and feelings always fall on deaf ears! \n\nTL;DR - having a kid has changed me into a bitter, depressed, drug-abusing, beaten down shell of a man who wishes for death.

Everything from my friends to the things I eat to how much I sleep. And honestly it\u2019s just so depressing. I feel really disappointed in myself. I feel like I\u2019m outgrowing the friends I have right now. All they seem to want to do is talk shit about others or follow trends.  But what can I do? I\u2019m lucky I even have friends. My grades are at an all time low. I\u2019ve started to give up. But at least I\u2019m not failing. I don\u2019t do shit at home. I feel like my family hates me. Everyone thinks the youngest gets the least shit but it\u2019s the opposite here. Everything is pointed to me. I take every blame, every fault, and every accusation thrown at me. I hate myself. I know I can look good if I try. But I don\u2019t try. Even if I did I would probably be too broke to do much. I feel like my personality is boring. I feel unloveable. Guys throw themselves at me but for what? My looks? Every single day I question if that\u2019s the only thing people appreciate. How I look. I rejected about four guys in the past two months. When my friends ask why they liked me they say : \u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d It stops there. I feel like a failure because no one will love me for what I think. Who I am as a person. I have complex thoughts too. I hate olives and bitter vegetables. I want to see the northern lights. I only love cookies and cream because vanilla tastes too plain for me. I write poetry to cope with the world. My imagination is absolutely crazy. I prefer skipping small talk. But who would know that? Who would know when noone wants to get to know me? When all everyone sees is my face? All I\u2019ve been thinking about lately is that I want someone who will hug me. Simply because they love me for me. Someone who will stay up with me until two am and open up. But the sad truth is that something of that sort would practically be impossible at my age. I\u2019m friends with about pretty much all guys and one girl. But all those guys ever talk about now is sex. I fucking hate it. I get it.. it\u2019s a human thing. But all the time? Where did the concept of actual love go? It pisses me off. I hate who they\u2019ve become. Just immature, borderline stupid and sex hungry friends who suck the energy out of me everyday. Yet they\u2019re all I have. I wish I could change my life. I love change. Yet it only happens when I don\u2019t want it. How do I change my life? How do I get away from this repetitive draining cycle? I want to meet new friends but I don\u2019t feel confident enough. It\u2019s like everything I want to do, and I KNOW I should do is countered with something I hate about myself. I just want it to be summer already so I can figure my shit out. I\u2019m going into tenth grade and I still haven\u2019t outgrown my middle school phase. It\u2019s pathetic. I just want to jump into a comic or a movie. I want to be someone else.

{"id": "eaz4bo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eaz4bo/all_it_takes_to_become_a_master_is_10000_hours/", "title": "\"All it takes to become a master is 10,000 hours\" and yet I still have nothing to show", "author": "JinTheBlue", "selftext": "You'll hear it around every now and then, 10,000 being the amount of time needed to become a master, or the first step to being good at something is being bad at it, or the master has failed more than the student has ever attempted, all in an effort to urge students of any craft to not give up in the face of adversity. Similarly I've heard countless times the tale that talent is a myth, invented as an excuse to never try, all in the vain of, you can do anything you set your mind to.  \n  \nI suppose I should give a bit of background. Aside the depression, I have two lovely conditions that make life just that much more difficult. First Aphantasia, the inability to see with my mind's eye, basically I have no sensory imagination, smell, touch, taste, and most importantly hearing and sight. I can describe a thing from memory, but I can't close my eyes and see it, and I can't hear a sound in my head, even if I could mimic it. The second is Disgraphia, which is a lack of fine mother control, and my particular type of it has some symptoms in common with dyslexia. Despite having these problems most of my life they were never a problem early on. I was put in remedial classes without really being told why, which was hard given that my issue was more a motor function issue than a learning one, like proper dyslexia, add, or the more problematic neurological issues of my piers. It wasn't until I wanted to do more than be passable that my problems actually became road blocks.  \n  \nI'll admit I'm lazy, and maybe in the end that's the only reason I wallow in self pity over the things out of my control, but I can't really say I'm good at anything. I've sink years of my life playing videogames, and sure I'm fluent enough to beat most any game I sit down with, but no matter the practice I put into anything competitive, I can't rise beyond the norm, years playing call of duty and Halo in highschool, or league of legends since then, and the best I can do  statistically, and objectively is OK, and even working to that point took hard work, time and effort. But games are games, so long as one is having fun it doesn't matter if you win or lose, only a few dozen can go pro at any given game, so what of practical skills.  \n  \n In college I broke rather hard. My Depression was at its worst and upon flunking out I finally went to get help in an effort to become stable again. The problem was that I could write or type fast enough to get by in highschool, but my hands couldn't keep up with the work load. Essays are taxing to write, or type with my daft hands, my notes are illegible, and I suppose I was too proud to be caught with a tape recorder. Thankfully at that point I was only three semesters in, so I admitted defeat and went into the workforce.  \n  \nAfter a few painful years of service industry work I started work in light industrial, and trade settings, but I feel out of place, I'm slower than everyone around me, and I've been laid off twice in the past year. Thankfully I keep finding work somehow, but I'm not sure I can take another job letting me go because I'm not one of the important employees to keep from downsizing. I guess so long as food is on the table, work need not define me, as there are other things in life that can give one meaning.  \n  \nDespite being blond in my mind's eye, or maybe because of it, I've always had an appreciation for artists. My mother, in her free time, is a painter, and plays with mosaics, my grandfather a carpenter, and my brother was a cartoonist for a while. All throughout my life I wanted a part of that, and about three and a half years ago I set aside occasionally doodling, and various sketches, buckled down and began to work on my fundementals, making sure to draw for fun on occasion, use reference, figure draw, I even studied books and online courses. Three and a half years later and I can't manage to manifest a drawing at will. If I'm lucky, I might be able to push an illustration to a finished state, it might even look good, but despite all that training all that work, maybe one in twenty times I sit to draw, I can see a piece through. I've invested in a tablet to work digitally, to help get me past the hurdles of my dysgraphia, and yet I will spend hours trying make the creative process work and yet nothing.  \n  \nAll around me I see people smiling and saying, \"You're doing fine, with some hard work you'll get there,\" but to me it just feels like \"Great, you've learned the rules, maybe if you tried harder you'd get there.\" I know I shouldn't be focusing on my work compared to others, and that there's more to life than ones skills, but it hurts whenever I try to make something of myself, and all that I'm greeted with is passed time. I find myself not wanting to try new things, why learn a new game for my friends to dance circles around me, why bother picking up an instrument I'll never be able to play, why go back to school if you'll only flunk out again.  \n  \nEven looking to philosophy has me on a rather sour note. The mind being that last refuge when the body has failed. I used to find a degree of comfort in existential nihilism, the thought that despite life being meaningless, we can create meaning for ourselves, but what meaning can I create when the things I wish to be good at elude my grasp. For a while I found peace in Taoism, and Zen, the philosophies of going where life takes you, and embracing what comes naturally, but passivity can only sasiate for so long, before hours in front of a canvas, or loss after loss begin to make one yearn to do nothing but sleep.  \n  \nThe older I get, the more I wish that time and effort were the only exchange for skill. Even after long days working I still have time in abundance, and practice isn't all too bad. Hell I can't even lean on my conditions as an excuse since when I go online I see others with them who say \"Yeah just practice more\"", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T13:48:09+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T13:48:09+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaz4bo/all_it_takes_to_become_a_master_is_10000_hours/"}

Later it turned into a deep and persistent depression that I still feel today. As a result I never cared to develop hobbies or social skill because why would I? I never expected to be here. I expected to be dead. I graduated highschool in 2015. I applied to college and got into a known but rather mediocre college, Georgia Southern University. During my time there I attempted to improve. I met some people, I went to social events, and I did average in terms of grades. I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the time. But my mental state degraded more and more. eventually my desire to improve dissipated, I began to lose social connections and my grades slumped. Come the second semester of my Sophomore year(2017) and I needed to take a medical withdrawal. I came back home for a semester in order to try and get better. During my time at home I enrolled at West Georgia University and took 3 extremely easy classes because I was so so afraid of falling behind academically. It was a stupid thing to do but I wasn't being very rational at this time. I went back to GSU fall semester of 2018 and the depression hit the hardest it has ever hit just a few weeks in. Near the end of the semester I began to self harm,drink heavily, and get high almost every night (22 at this point btw) and when I told my psychologist she rightfully had me committed to a psych hospital. I spent 9 days there where I was diagnosed as Bipolar. Initially I felt hopeful. I finally had a solid diagnosis that I could get professional help for. After I got out I came back home yet again. I am now 23 and turning 24 in July. a few months ago I was admitted to another psych hospital(this time voluntarily) and spent 8 days there. After I got out I spent 2 months in a intensive outpatient program that the hospital ran. I came to the facility at 8:30 am and left at 3:00pm everyday for 2 months and I have never felt more alone in my life than before. There were about 30 other people around my age that were going through the same things that I was and they were/are sill more productive and successful than I am. To give you an idea as to how socially incompetent I am the doctors tested me for autism. I'm not autistic according to the doctors I'm just socially awkward. presently I am enrolled at KSU. I have failed 2 of my 3 classes for this semester. I will have to switch majors. I'm thinking of going into software development but I don't know. I am living in the basement of my parents house and I am unemployed because I just cant handle a job right now. At 23 I am already this much of a fucking failure. I have been seriously considering suicide but if I do decide to do it I will do it after Christmas. I just don't see any hope for me. I am too far gone. I don't even feel like a person at all. I don't know what to do and its tearing me apart. I'm so so tired. I'm tired of being a failure. I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'm tired of being this apathetic husk of a human being. I want to go home but I don't know where home is.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T11:22:27+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T11:22:28+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaxw70/i23m_feel_as_if_i_am_not_salvageable_at_this_point/"}

My ex wife has no empathy for the things I had to deal with growing up, not because she\u2019s an uncaring person, but because she\u2019s had her own trauma. As things were, we were relatively amicable, though I find her to be incredibly frustrating more often than not. \n\nNovember 2019 was literally the hardest time of my life. I took a severe spinal injury at work and have been left barely able to walk. I\u2019m receiving workman\u2019s comp benefits but it\u2019s definitely not enough to keep up with my bills, and I\u2019m also supporting my two year old daughter (light of my life, only thing keeping me together) half time. Cash is rough, I\u2019m doing what I can.\n\nThree days after my injury, I\u2019ve been declared unfit to work, everything\u2019s up in the air. I go to my weekly game night with a group of my oldest friends. It\u2019s really the only outlet I have. Due to my job, I\u2019ve kind of had to cut back on my social interactions because it\u2019s an \u201calways on call, and we\u2019re not paying you extra for that\u201d situation. Normally we play D&amp;D, sometimes we just dick around and hangout. One of my closest friends since 2007 ODs on heroin. The rest of this friend group is clean, literally the worst anyone else has done is smoke pot, and not regularly. We\u2019ll call the ODing friend J. J is all over the place, half passing out, and it takes a few of us to get him able to sit and stay coherent for even a minute. Absolutely terrifying. I get a hold of J\u2019s longtime girlfriend, take him home, and J\u2019s Girlfriend and I stage an intervention. The next day, we put him into rehab. \n\nAnd my GF of quite a while breaks up with me. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been my problem. His family should have handled it. I needed to be recovering. I wouldn\u2019t have had this problem if it weren\u2019t for my stupid game night. You didn\u2019t show me this kind of worry when I tried to kill myself when we weren\u2019t together and I didn\u2019t tell you about it until months after the fact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just me, and this is totally fucked up right? She was right though: no, it shouldn\u2019t have been my problem. J doesn\u2019t have family within 3 hours, though. J didn\u2019t have anyone but his girlfriend and I. I\u2019m not going to abandon someone when they need me. \n\nI can barely walk. J is doing great since he got discharged, blowing off people he would\u2019ve gotten pills from, striking up genuine relationships with his counselors, and making an active effort to better his life. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how proud of him I am. He is once again the person I became friends with. \n\nI have innumerable other issues, stemming from childhood abandonment and physical and sexual abuse, but I\u2019m trying to make my life better. I\u2019m trying to be strong, and good, and give my daughter all of the things that were denied to me as a kid. \n\nMy ex wife is overstepping boundaries by going to visit the father that abandoned me when I was a kid, whom I have since reconciled with but have had an incredibly strained relationship with since. While it seems like she may be pushing for a reconciliation, she also will NOT be alone with me, instead opting to invite her best (and possibly only) friend to every interaction we may have, even when I specifically try to define something as \u201cfamily time.\u201d I can barely leave my house due to my injuries, and I feel as if it reflects on me that I am a bad father when I am physically unable to do much more than microwave dinner and put on the TV and snuggle with my kid. I desperately want to talk to my now-ex girlfriend to let her know that \u201chey, you were right, my family is acting super shady and trying to involve my ex in stuff.\u201d Even though we split up over me (probably over)extending myself to help J. I can\u2019t keep up with my bills, and I have few people to lean on. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what else to say. There are details I\u2019ve left out. If you\u2019re curious, feel free to message me. At no point have I ever been physically abusive to anyone, and I try to make an effort to be understanding in all cases. I just really need help, and to be quite frank, I need an anonymous internet message board to dump to out of the hope that someone, somewhere will listen to me and validate me and say \u201chey, you\u2019re doing great, and you\u2019re a good person.\u201d\n\nI just feel so alone in trying to be good in a really bad fucked up world.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T10:30:28+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T10:30:28+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 2, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaxi9h/ive_never_felt_so_alone/"}

Its unheard of.", "author": "Oldcayde6", "selftext": "     It's sad because we desensitize ourselves from the thought of not feeling adequate. We learn that hard work brings success and with success comes happiness. But we aren't taught on how to handle failure. How to handle our emotions when things fall apart. How to reach out to, and talk to someone about the thoughts that swirl in our minds. \n     Ever since we moved to the states, my mental state has just been continuously deteriorating. And I can't put the blame on anyone else but myself. I was and ironically still am the type of person to always put the emotions of my peers before mine. I'd crack jokes, check on people and go out of my way to make sure everyone was ok. When asked if I was I'd always answer with \"always am\" or \"no need to worry\" with that smile across my face. I'd have a hard time talking to people. \n     Years after years I just kept declining. After getting out of a 4 year relationship with someone with whome I was willing to settle down with I felt like all hope was lost. I lost faith in myself, I lost hope but most of all i lost faith in God and my religion. I remember I would always fade into my mind and just beg for a sign that things would look up or for guidance and I would curse at God for not helping me and I felt abandoned. It got to the point where I began to have those thoughts. I would cry and think and question myself, life, my faith. I would ask myself why I was put on this earth. As a symbol of failure? A mockery? What with did I have? What was the point. And I acted upon my thoughts. Thric. To no avail. After the third time I felt lost. I didn't know what to do. I remember laying on the floor the night I attempted for the third time. I was going through my wallet to get all my items sorted after my passing and I found a picture of myself and my little sister. I looked happy and she looked happier. Her smile brought tears to my eyes. I felt a hint of hope. \n     If it weren't for her I wouldn't be here today, fighting to be a better me. If it weren't for here I wouldn't have met my fiance.

The pay is low if you compare between countries but where I live it's alright although still not much. I don't even know what I get out of bed for every day... I just go to work till late, come back and scroll websites looking for movies/shows to watch and hardly ever find anything good. \nI don't like sports (dislike running, swimming is a so-so option), my only passion is in motorcycling (riding for leisure). Early this year a motorcycle caught my eye and I've brought this topic up with my mom before thinking and hoping she would support my decision to buy it (naive as I was) but got a super strong reaction from her and so I got scared and did nothing. I'm 24, I'm of legal age so it's not like I have to have her permission but however old I am or however far I live from her her strong objection is still a powerful deterrent and it haunts me. But I was determined to make it a reality so I took on 2 more side jobs on weekends (2 teaching jobs and 1 casual peddling job) cuz I thought I could justify to myself better if the bike money came out of other money instead of my regular salary although I could've afforded the bike in the first place without the side jobs. Fast forward a few months, I still have no passion that I can act upon, just going to work for nothing and come back home to nothing, I finally found a bike that I feel is \"the bike\". Super good bargain, great bike, it's the bike that I feel that if I miss it I will never have this chance again. I asked my sister if she'd support my decision so that I can at least have some peace in my heart and not just negative images and admonitions that are haunting me... she wasn't supportive at all. She told me to find another safer hobby but I don't want to settle with an ok, watered-down option as motorcycling has been the only thing I can see myself with... being depressed for so long  (still am) motorcycling is the only thing that awakens something in me... it's part of my identity.\nAt the same time I can't just buy it cuz although I live away from my parents (I live together with my sister) and they visit sometimes, I can't keep the bike at home and I can't find anywhere else to hide it (storage facilities in my country isn't as prevalent and accessible as in western countries, I found one but they prohibit vehicles/motorcycles storing). So now I'm standing here on a weekend peddling things (which I had set out to do in order to fund my dreams) yet it seems that while I am financially capable of pursuing it, the dream is drifting further and further away. I seriously can't stop thinking about motorcycles and especially *that* motorcycle, I don't know why I'm doing this and I don't know what to do. I feel like a walking corpse. I've long thought that it was alright if I didn't like my work life cuz I could at least have a life I like outside of work, but the fact is, I don't.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T09:53:56+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T09:53:57+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eax85e/so_tired_of_my_existence/"}

I'm doing a course at university that I love and I have a job that I don't mind. Regardless of all of this, every Sunday, before the week starts, I feel awful, work terrifies me, I go and it's really not that bad but there's fear linked to everything I do. It's constant. Thoughts such as dying on my way and never seeing anyone again, I worry about getting trapped there, I worry about collapsing. All sorts. It's relentless, I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll feel so sad it's almost like I'm dead, I'll wake up in the night filled with dread and fear, thoughts that I'll go to hell, thoughts that I'll lose everything. I try to push through, I used to see finishing work and going everyday as winning but the days of this pain turned to weeks and weeks to months and I've realised there is no winning, I'm only losing, it's ruining my life and I don't know how to feel normal, I'm not sure if I've ever felt normal. My girlfriend is away now for a few weeks as she's finished uni and seeing her really helped me to get through these hard day's as I knew even at its worse I could go and see her and just have some time where I don't worry about anything, where I can just feel happy and safe. She's only a couple of hours away, so I can go and see her but with work and things we're both busy and she's only just gone back and I don't want to seem too clingy, especially since she'll be catching up with her friends and family. I want to give her some space. So, I'm on my own and I don't know how I'm going to get through this and I don't think there's anything anyone can do to help me, I just needed to write this because its crippling.

It was self diagnosed for a long time but in University I decided to actually talk about it. I went to the campus doctor and told them how I felt and for how long I've felt this way and was diagnosed with clinical depression.\n\nHonestly it felt kinda validating. The doctor asked if I was open to antidepressants and I told him I wasn't (I know a lot about the side effects and was scared it would make my suicidal fantasy more stronger). He really pushed me to take them but after I said no he told me to regularly talk to the campus therapist, and I agreed.\n\nMy experience with the therapist was strange. I found it extremely difficult to open up and found myself leaving out a lot of things I just didn't want to say. Whole she told me some comping mechanism every time I would come to talk to her I had to remind her of who I was and then she'd skim my file before picking up where we left off. I found this to be extremely off putting and it made it even more difficult for me to open up. After a month or two I just stopped going. And went back to my regular routine of self treatment, mostly when I'm in an episode of manic depression I just cut myself off from people.\n\nAfter that I visited the doctor again before I graduated for an unrelated reason and he asked me if I wanted to be prescribed antidepressant. I had refused once again as at the time I was managing pretty well. But I found it weird that it was being pushed on me. I have reservations as well as I find myself to be a deep thinker and a creative person, my depression has either been the source of the creativity or the the thing that strips me of that creativity.\n\nI wanted to know if I made a good call not taking antidepressants?", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T09:32:41+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T09:32:42+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eax2f6/depression_treatments_and_my_experience/"}

I've been going to college since summer of 2016, and I don't have an AA yet. I had a good start, 2016 was a great year for me. Then 2017 was a terrible year for me, I failed a handful of classes that year. I still maintained my GPA and it didn't get lower than a 2.0. 2018 was the year I rebounded. I improved in classes as well as my GPA, and the Spring of 2019 was a good semester too, I only failed Chemistry 2, but passed it when I retook it next summer. But the next summer is when shit started to go downhill from here. I took a calculus course and I failed, it was hard, but I'm being honest, I failed because I was caught cheating on a test, I own up to it now and attended a seminar for redemption, but I also didn't do too well in my biology 2 lab, it was too fast paced, and I experienced a lot of difficulties in getting my lab report done in time, I'm a very slow writer. Anyways, the following semester, I retook those two classes, without any cheating, and I didn't pass. Every time I take a test, my mind draws a blank, which is why I've had temptations of cheating, but obviously didn't want to go through the same thing over again. Every semester, I'm always stressed because my sadness would often yell at me and threaten to kick me out of the house if I dont pass my classes, I honestly was not planning on having this happe to me. I'm freaking out because that's was my second attempt at taking those classes meaning that the third attempt, I have to pay out of state tuition, which is no big deal because there should be a fee waiver I'm able to submit. But what I'm freaking out about the oat was that I was placed on financial aid warning because in the semester, I had a higher fail pass ratio, I failed more classes than I passed. They paid for my fall semester, but since I blew it, I'm panicking. I don't know how my future will be. Ive definitely learned from my mistakes am doing feel like I'll do better next time but still, I failed, so I don't know if there will be a next time. I feel pretty lost right now. And Im scared, my dad has hit me numerous times in the past for not doing well in school. I changed majors, originally going for pharmacy, now changing into Information Technology. But I still need to get my AA in order to transfer schools and get my bachelors. Basically, because of this screw up and my situation, Im considering suicide, because I'm too scared to show my parents my grade, they always punish my in the worst ways. And in some cases, Ive even came close to getting kicked out. It's not my fault I suck at math. Trigonometry was easy, but calculus is a nightmare. And biology is super boring for me. I'm just scared, know what to do. My dad would probably force me to quit my job, but I actually love my job and it's helping me become more independent. Just give me some advice or some, thanks. My parents always find an excuse to why I didn't pass my classes. I don't watch tv as much as I used to. I don't listen to music as much as I used to. They won't let me use social media, so I virtually have no social life, and I don't play video games.

I left my job because I heard of a better job opportunity from a friend. This opportunity consisted of me moving 12 hours away from home and working manual labor and what was supposed to be a better paying job than my shitty retail job. \n\nLong story short after I quit my full time job with benefits, and pursued that other job. I got screwed over and ended up working for 3 weeks with out getting paid from the other job. I had spent my own money living in motels being promised good pay for nothing.... I was fucked I had to find a job back home now.... upon returning home my dog who I\u2019ve had for 13 years suddenly fell ill. My baby needed surgery so I got her surgery and it racked up another $2500 on top of my existing debt. After the surgery she was fine for about a week and then got very ill again couldn\u2019t walk or eat and we ended up having to put her down... my depression sky rocketed about a week after when it all sunk in.. I smoked weed and had an extreme panic attack and haven\u2019t really been the same since... I reached out for help from my home church I hopes of finding some kind of faith to pick me up... well upon returning to church one of my closest friends calls me and tells me she\u2019s been having an affair with one of the head pastors whom I looked up too.... and this hit hard because in a moment of crisis you look towards people who you think are strong.... and the people I ran are all broken... I then found out that one of my best friends who I hooked up with another good friend of mine was being abused by the guy I hooked her up with which no one saw that coming... then I got super sick for a week straight and was out on my ass feeling like I was about to die... fast forward a month and I\u2019m here today still just mentally exhausted emotionally exhausted... I\u2019m scraping myself up off the floor to work again and I\u2019m working with my dad doing basic construction. I just turned 24 and I feel like I\u2019ve wasted the last 4 years of my life doing nothing....at this point in time I can\u2019t see my self doing anything in the future... I\u2019ve been with my girlfriend for almost 7 years now... and It hurts me to be with her feeling like I\u2019m a failure... she loves me so much and tells me that I\u2019m not a failure and that it will be ok and I want to believe her but it\u2019s hard. I feel like I let my family down and her family down and myself down... but I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve never been this low and I never want to feel so worthless ever again.. normally I\u2019m upbeat and inspirational and people love me...\n\nI have nothing but debt to show for the last 24 years of my life I dropped out of college, and just don\u2019t have much direction in life... I need help.. Has anyone felt this low? \n\nI ruminate on old things. I feel inadequate and I stutter now when I say my name.. it\u2019s hell to be honest.

It\u2019s my birthday and I turned 26 yrs. old. I don\u2019t like aging. I worry everyday about the future. Not for myself but for my family. I don\u2019t want them to get sick, I don\u2019t want them to pass on due to age. I don\u2019t want to ever face that kind of pain. It terrifies me. Anyway, today I had to put my beloved pet ferret to sleep and I\u2019m heartbroken. I feel guilty and angry at myself for not being able keep her healthy. The vet said it was possibly cancer or enlarged pancreas about 3 wks. ago. She started having bouts of illness about a year or so into my time with her, but she always bounced back. Surgery was out of the question financially and the odds of her recovering was slim. Her small belly was swollen and she could barely walk today. She was eating very little and extremely thin. I knew the time was coming but I didn\u2019t want to face the truth. She would attempt to play but due to weakness she would lay down every few mins. I hope I did the right thing. Anyway, I held her after they stuck her with a needle and injected the fatal dose. What saddens me the most is when the vet was doing it she wiggled around in her grip a bit and to me it felt like she was uncomfortable and maybe I shouldn\u2019t have let it happen. I held her as she passed and it took a few mins. My mom and I cried together and talked about it to try and justify what had just happened. My mom is always so strong but during the car ride home, while holding a Tupperware container with her little body in my mom told me she felt like when our pets die she feels it\u2019s punishment for not being there when her mother passed away when she was 16. I told her it wasn\u2019t her fault and she was just a child. It hurt my heart. It makes me sad that she feels that way. When we made it home my dad dug a hole under our porch and I made a little tombstone. Some backstory, my little girl was given to me by my sister as a graduation gift. She only lived 3 1/2 yrs. It all hit me hard and I just can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I can\u2019t stop worrying. I can\u2019t sleep. I pray she\u2019s in a better place. A few hours later, I had a birthday dinner with my family and my husbands family and I tried to be in good spirits but I noticed myself getting irritable and sad and just not knowing how to feel. After the dinner I felt like I made everyone upset for not acting like myself and not coming across as thankful. I was very thankful but I don\u2019t know if it came across that way.  I just don\u2019t want anyone to be sad or upset with me or in general . I\u2019d rather feel all the pain so no one else has to. I sit here worrying and I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m not asking for pity and I just there is someone that can tell me I did or did not do the right thing. If this post isn\u2019t allowed here I understand.

My friends were leaving me on read and ignored my messages asking for help. I have better friends now but I don\u2019t think that friends ignoring you for one evening should make you think about suicide. My then boyfriend also broke up with me about a week or two ago and I really relied on him to help me with coping with anxiety and depression. (There were many red flags when I was with him though. I don\u2019t think I can list them all but here are some: he said he was single but I found out he was dating another girl when he started to date me; When asked why he was with me, he would say just because he thought I was hot). When he told me I was too annoying because I was always complaining about my issues to him, he said he was done with me. I was really heartbroken. I guess I just fall too hard lol. But I do believe that I have grown so much and I have finally gotten the support and help I need. I\u2019m very glad to be alive and even though some days I still am very depressed, I have a net of friends and my parents who will be there to help and I know I\u2019ll be okay.

I stopped paying attention to classes the year before when I didn't know what or why I was doing anything in life, then I stopped going to some classes, and even took an important class off of my schedule with the purpose of taking it again during summer. \n\nSummer comes and I couldn't focus on it. I felt anxious just going to class and looking at the board, and I failed it again. Not wanting to tell anyone I just lied about it. \n\nThen I stopped going to college through the whole year and lied to my parents saying I wanted to change careers because that one wasn't what I wanted. It was my fault and I know it. Then I did actually change careers, and it was all going okay, I fucked up the first test, and then the second. Then I pulled an all-nighter and got a B on the third test, I felt like I could pass the class finally if I put more effort. \n\nComes the final and I tried practicing for it through the weekend (Thursday-Monday). I kept doing other stuff feeling like I had time. Comes Sunday and I take my notes out and start going through some stuff, but then again stop because \"I have time\". Then Monday and I start studying right after waking up. I keep taking breaks and doing other things through the day. Until I finally start studying. I redo the problems from the first and second test, noticing all the mistakes I made and realizing how to solve the problems in the process, it wasn't that hard I thought. I redo the material that was left out for the supposed fourth test, and yeah I know how to do it.\n\nI stayed all night awake, looking at the notes, going through problems, trying to memorize every formula I'll need. Then I go to the class and see my classmates going through things on the board and jump in, and I know how to do a lot of things there, kept getting anxious through the whole day. When the test finally starts I just don't know how to solve the problems, they're the hardest ones that I don't remember seeing anywhere. \n\nI needed a B on the final to get pass it with a C, and I'm not sure of what a D would do, but it feels like it'll be a miracle if I even make it to a D on the final and get a D for the semester. My college doesn't allow anyone to take a class more than three times, and this was the third. Every other college here is either too expensive, bad, and/or doesn't have what I want to study. \n\nI fucked it all up, it's all my fault, I should've spent more time on it, or started trying hard since the beginning of the semester and not nearing the end. Now I don't know what to do anymore. After an entire year of feeling lost and hopeless, I thought I had it finally, but no. I had to go and fuck it up one more time, because that's how I am.\n\nI'm not even capable of crying, it just feels horrible.

It's killing me inside.", "author": "goodfashion20", "selftext": "I'm currently 26, and just recently I've reflected on my life thus far, and how I've wasted most of it. Whenever people discover their passions for things it's usually during childhood or adolescence. And I'm not necessarily talking about career paths, though some of them discover that too. I'm talking about things that they are passionate about, their calling in life. It could be things like acting/drama, music, art, animation, football, martial arts, snowboarding, skateboarding, coding, etc. I on the other hand completely wasted my youth. I did a little cello as a child, but I was never really devoted to it, and pretty much stayed a beginner. I did some guitar as a teenager, but eventually fell out of that too. I did martial arts on and off, but never seriously dedicated myself to the craft. I pretty much remained at beginner/intermediate levels. I guess the only thing that I kind of got into in high school was archery. But even then, I never really became a marksman, and after I moved for community college, I pretty much stopped (I don't own a bow or arrows, so I couldn't anyway). As for acting, I've taken one improv course as a kid, but nothing ever came of it. And I've sparsely taken a few acting classes throughout college. But I never actively pursued acting. Oh, and about that, I'm still technically in college, but I'm on my last few units (that's a topic for another day). The main problem is that I've been unmotivated throughout most of my life. I've never been willing to take the extra steps, and I've always quit when things got hard or uncomfortable. And it's really impaired me as a person. At 26, most people are experts at something or another. They can call themselves something. But a very hard fact hit me like a brick to the face recently. I'm nothing. I'm literally nothing. I haven't mastered anything, I haven't developed any skills or passions. And now I worry that it might be too late.\n\nThis semester, I took a Theatre Appreciation course (to fulfill one of my degree requirements). Despite it being an \"appreciation course\" each group in the class did a performance at the end of the semester as our final. And that's where it hit me. I really want to get into acting. I should mention that I chose film/T.V. production as my major. I feel that it may have been the wrong path, as I'm not exactly interested in being a director (at least not yet). I primarily focused on screenwriting, cinematography, and editing throughout college. With my degree, I can at least make a living doing corporate videography for tech companies or something. But to me videography is more of means to make a living. I enjoy it, but it's not my main pattion. I had an interest in acting throughout college, but I never actively pursued it. I didn't get involved in any school productions, I didn't audition for any roles in school films or on backstage. But whenever I'm able to perform and become a different person, I really get into it and it really makes me happy. I've also started to teach myself piano (via keyboard), and I've developed a keen interest in music. I plan on dusting off my guitar and really dedicating myself to the instrument. I'm also getting back into martial arts, though mostly for myself (not to compete). I also plan to get back into archery. \n\nThere's something inside me right now that I've never felt before. A sense of drive to really succeed at all of the things I'm interested in and give me joy. However, there is one sad fact that I have to swallow. Most of the people who've chosen to become actors or musicians (or even martial artists!) have dedicated most of their lives to their craft. What business do I, at 26, to claim to be a musician or an actor, when I haven't been actively involved in either growing up. I was never in any school productions, I never auditioned for any roles, I wasn't in bands in high school. I was a lazy, good for nothing, who was never happy. It pains me to know that there are people who know what they want to do or were heavily involved in activities growing up. Once they get to my age, they are equipped to have some sort of professional involvement. Yes they probably all have day jobs, but that's not the point. None of them started from the ground up at 26. At this point they probably all have day jobs while actively pursuing music/acting/whatever passions they have. Some might have already gone pro. My sister is 33 and is just about to go pro as a stage actress. However she's been involved in dancing, acting, and singing most of her life, like most people in the field. I'm happy for her, but it pains me to know that I've wasted my life. I know it's my fault for the situation I'm in right now, but I can't help feeling bitter and envious of all the people who knew what they wanted to do at a young age. I want those years back. If it is truly too late for me to pursue what I want, then there really is no point in me continuing to live. Everyday, the thought that I've somehow missed the boat causes me pain inside. I'm at a complete loss. On one hand I feel more motivation and drive to do what I want. On the other hand, I haven't devoted enough of my life what I'm currently passionate in. I literally feel like I'm being ripped in half by these two thoughts. I'm worried that I've missed my only chance to be happy. It pains me to see all of the artists, musicians, actors, gymnasts, race car drivers (not into race car driving but you get the picture), martial artists etc., who are all my age (or younger), who are all either professionals or have at least have advanced skills in their field. I feel where I'm at in terms of acting and music is where most people are at when they are like 12 or 13. Heck some 12 or 13 year olds are already ahead of me. But what can I do? The idea that it might be too late is too painful to bear. \n\nIf it turns out that it is too late, I might just end it all and take my own life. Sometimes I feel tempted to cross that line. Better that then to deal with the lifetime of pain of knowing that it's too late to do what I want to. I've already had to deal with the pain of missing out on all the milestones most people experience such as dating, making lifelong friends, getting a license at 18, living the undergrad life (Having transferred at 25), having a youth, etc. I wasn't even able to meet the bare minimum of an average life growing up. Again that's another topic, but these things all add up. Some days I already feel like I'm dying inside.\n\nIf anyone has any advice please tell me.

I don\u2019t know why, I just volunteered to be your introduction to the school and everything. And straight away when I saw you in the main entrance there was just something that made me happy, because truly I hadn\u2019t been before. Over that week you and I became friends, we bonded over our love for videogames, trampolining, memes, stupid stuff, but still there was something that made me feel so happy. And you were happy around me. People made fun of us and didn\u2019t really like us too much but we didn\u2019t care. Maybe it\u2019s cuz we looked alike, or because we just got eachother so well, I\u2019m not sure. You thought I was so cool, but deep down I thought you were much cooler, funnier, and better than me. \n\nSo many memories together too. Sitting in the back of our classroom at lunch playing minecraft, messing around, looking at memes, laughing, just enjoying being together. You did say that you never met someone so much like yourself as I was. Everything is a blur now, because now all I remember is you telling us that you had to leave. I didn\u2019t really react at all. Just bottled up how I felt deep down and completely blanked you, because it was easier. You were leaving, (permanently) anyway, so I just clawed you out of my head and emotions.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. I should\u2019ve been there for you when you left, but instead I wasn\u2019t even in school that final day. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t even tell you. I\u2019m writing this because I saw a picture of you the other day and broke down looking at it. Because everything came flooding back. You were with me for a year, and I knew you were the person I wanted at least 100 years with. And then you left. And I didn\u2019t even say goodbye for god sake. I should\u2019ve been a better person and just hugged you and cried like everyone else did, but no, I had to be a cold hearted loser. I loved that year, and looking back you mean so much to me. Please, I don\u2019t want to ruin what we have. I\u2019ve ruined so much in the past with people, and I\u2019m a terrible person for it.

I genuinely enjoyed school, my teachers, my friends, outside activities.\n\nMy senior year of high school this lower classman who was hitting on me for the past couple of months (I can\u2019t take a hint) asks me out. This became the leading joy in my life. We immediately hit it off, talking about everything for hours, never holding back because we wholeheartedly trusted each other. Every time I would have a tough time at school I would remember that I have a date with her over the weekend to look forward to, etc.\n\nShe turned my life from a normal and to be honest relatively unfulfilling life to something that made me happy all hours of the day.\n\n Because I was a senior I eventually graduated and went to a university not too far away but enough to be slightly annoying. But things were still doing really well with her. We spend loads of time over summer break and I\u2019m able to make it through my new grueling college classes by thinking about the next weekend or break that I get to be with her.\n\nThe first semester finishes. Things are going well. We spend a lot of time over break, and eventually part again to start the next semester.\n\nCommunication is normal, but I get the feeling that something is not right. It\u2019s March now, it\u2019s been a long stretch and I haven\u2019t seen her in two months but we text everyday and FaceTime every other. I mention her birthday and that I\u2019m thinking about getting something really nice for her but she immediately gets very defensive about the idea of getting her a gift. Nothing so far in my life has set off more alarm bells in my head. I let the idea of a gift rest and we finish the convo. I have a panic attack for the next two hours and call back.\n\nI tell her that I\u2019m not doing so well because I have a weird feeling that she is going to break up with me.\n\nShe then proceeds to do exactly that. It was my fault that she broke up through the phone but it still wasn\u2019t good. Her reasoning was very vacuous and imprecise. All I could manage to say after a minute of silence was,\n\n\u201cI respect your decision\u201d\n\nI kept this away from my best friend for a week, away from my family for a few more weeks, I didn\u2019t want to be a burden. Nothing felt good anymore. There was nothing to look forward to. No times to cuddle and feel loved, nothing. All I had was hours upon hours of Multivariable Calc to do.\n\nHer lack of a reason destroyed me on quiet nights. My head coming up with reason upon reason, some more plausible than others.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 7 months of torture until I had a real conversation about it with one of my friends. One of the first things he mentions is, \u201cYeah I don\u2019t know too much about you two but it was kinda shitty of her to get with **** immediately after you broke up\u201d\n\nThe guy she constantly told me was no big deal, the man I jokingly acted jealous about. She had gotten with that guy most definitely any amount of months before she left me.\n\nThe person I trusted the most. The person that gave my life a meaning. The person I tried to make the happiest in the world. The only person to ever show me affection... decided that I wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nI want so desperately to be able to have a trusting and loving relationship but I\u2019m so unbelievably mentally destroyed by being cheated on (in my first relationship). Friends tell me I\u2019m attractive, they meme about how I\u2019m getting with everyone, they say \u201cI\u2019m such a nice and genuine and interesting person\u201d\n\nI rationalize that they must be lying because why else would no one approach me, why else would I feel so alone. I plaster on a happy face and when that sometimes fails I just say that I\u2019m stressed.\n\nEvery day I wish that I hadn\u2019t woken up, every day I wish I had never her.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T06:51:01+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T06:51:02+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 15, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eavrxu/my_lack_luster_experiences_forever_changed_my/"}

As I grow, I put distance between us to avoid bad memories.\n\nBut it didn't work.\n\nI became addicted to alcohol and weed to be able to sleep, supress anxiety and feel warm again.\n\nIt made me worse.\n\nI lost too much to my addictions. I made a fantasy world and live in it. Fuel it with alcohol, weed or whatever I have that day.\n\nI didn't answer my phones. I didn't call anybody.

I lost control. I couldn't even remember details, I was so out of my mind.\n\nI did not learn to face my feelings sober. I can not think straight due to all of that substances that made my soul and brain numb.\n\nI lost the opportunity and this time it hit me hard. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. All I can do was beat myself, what an idiot I am.\n\nThen I decided, I am done with this lifestyle.\n\nI saw a doctor and diagnosed GAD, probably due to daily drinking and smoking weed.\n\nNow I am a 27 years old guy who had pushed every good opportunity, loved ones away. I feel terible. All I feel is regret and sorrow.\n\nBut I learnt my lesson and I am one week sober. I will address my depression and anxiety sober and beat it.\n\nI am facing with all the emotions, decisions and consequences I have been avoiding last 8 years.\n\nI feel terrible. Sometimes, I feel suicidal. But I didn't drink. This time I know that drinking and smoking will numb the pain, I will be high and happy for several hours but I will wake up next morning with more anxiety, more regrets.\n\nNow I am trying to find myself again.

I just want to have somebody beside me during the tough times. I've been so stressed out lately that my eyes and other muscles in my body have been consistently twitching. I've been working my ass off to get people Christmas gifts, people that I doubt would even appreciate them anyways, but I want to be nice and show the few people in my life that I appreciate them even if the feeling isn't reciprocated. Every paycheck I get this month is going to Christmas. I might as well just take a goddamn lighter to my paychecks. It'd warrant similar results anyways. Christmas is such a goddamn stupid time of year. But I'll make a separate post about that tomorrow. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I'm really getting sick of it. Nothing I do feels worth it anymore. I don't feel loved. I don't feel appreciated. I don't feel like I'm needed. I feel like I could vanish right now and not a single ripple would occur in the world.

I'm pretty new to all this so I'll do the best that I can to tell my story in a simple manner. Earlier this year, my father passed away in April due to heart failure. I was at work at the time and my little brother was the first one to discover the body. He called 911 and attempted CPR on my dad but wasn't able to revive him. I received numerous missed calls from my brother at work and luckily I was able to leave work early after explaining the situation to my manager. I drove to my house as fast as I could and the first thing I saw was a fire truck and several police cars surrounding my house. I ran only to be stopped by one of the paramedics and he told me that my father died. I was shocked but my biggest concern was my brother. As I walked up the stairs, a chill ran up my spine as my brother's cries became louder and louder. I hugged him but didn't utter a word. My mom was out of state but spread the news to all of my relatives. I remember calling my sister and the first thing I heard was, \"please tell me it's not true.\" I was busy calming down my brother while being bombarded with questions from the police but only when I was alone did I actually cry. My brother is doing a lot better. He just turned 14 not too long ago and is participating in many after school clubs. I have been focusing on boosting my family's morale whenever I can, which included cooking and telling stupid jokes just to get a chuckle from my family.  I'm 23 now and work at a dead-end retail job that I have no problem quitting, but I just don't know what kind of job I'd like to do once I quit. I barely passed high school and didn't even bother finishing community college so I don't have anything good to put on my resume. I spend 40+ hours a week getting berated by customers only to get a small paycheck every other week and by the time I get back home, I'm exhausted and have no motivation to do anything. I don't know what I want to do in life and doing something as simple as playing videogames or watching tv as become a chore. Basically, I feel so empty on the inside and I only put a smile on my face when I'm with family just so that I don't feel like one extra burden for my family to bear. I feel like I'm being selfish, like I have no right to be sad right now, especially after all the things that my brother had to go through. I want to be there for my brother but I don't want him to know that the person he is looking up to, his carefree older brother, is just a fraud who is barely making ends meet with his crappy job and can't even decide his own future.

Things spiraled out of control when we tried to get molly from his moms new boyfriend and were unwittingly sold meth, which we got hooked on.\n\nFast forward a few years and I\u2019m 18 selling drugs and living in a trap house with my new best friend (we\u2019ll call him Monty). Monty and I were close as hell, and sold Xanax, cocaine, weed, and moon rocks (very potent molly) together. During this time I made many bad decisions.\n\nI lied, stole, hurt, cheated, manipulated and pretty much every other shitty thing you can do.  This period of my life earned me a dui and 2 stays in jail (6 if you include overnights).\n\nI\u2019m 23 now and if you met me today you\u2019d never guess any of this. \n\nI\u2019ve changed for the better and I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m generally a good person these days. I always help those in need, am clean off all drugs (except occasional weed and I drink often to self medicate), I don\u2019t break any laws and the people I meet fall in love with me.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this... I guess because I\u2019m not religious and this is some form of secular confession. But I\u2019m sad. And lonely. I\u2019m worried if people knew what I\u2019ve done they couldn\u2019t look at me the same, so I push them away. Every day there\u2019s a devil on my right shoulder telling me I\u2019m unworthy of love, but there\u2019s no angel on my left.\n\nThanks to anyone who actually read the whole thing, I really appreciate it.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T05:42:11+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T05:42:12+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eav61y/ive_done_bad_things_and_i_dont_think_i_deserve/"}

I remember self harming at age 6 and trying to kms at age 14. I was a neglected as well as physically and mentally abused child. Once I moved out of my parent\u00b4s house I was hit with PTSD because of what I went through. I learned to dissociate when very young, and I still do it involuntarily to the extent it\u00b4s a problem in daily life. Not only do I go numb emotionally, I tend to zone out at any time. It\u00b4s like I\u00b4m just not there.\n\nI excelled in school and at university but have never been able to hold onto a job because of my issues. I\u00b4m just wrong and don\u00b4t fit in anywhere, even though I have a high IQ. I\u00b4m currently a student working on a second degree, mostly because I can\u00b4t stand being home. As soon as I get home it\u00b4s like a heavy wet blanket is thrown over me and I can\u00b4t breathe. Being home causes anxiety. Being around people makes me feel alienated, because it\u00b4s so clear I\u00b4m very different from everyone else. I don\u00b4t have anything in common with them. \n\nMy issues have made it impossible to sustain any lasting relationships, and I have also don\u00b4t like any sort of physical contact with others. My last boyfriend acknowledged I am very different from others which is what made him interested in the first place, but unfortunately he eventually lost interest, and I can\u00b4t blame him. I wouldn\u00b4t want to be with me. I never had a normal life and was never able to develop a normal and functioning personality. To my defense, if I ever hurt anyone it wasn\u00b4t deliberatly.\n\nI once OD\u00b4d on roofies mixed with champagne and slept for two days straight. I wish I had died.

How are you? I hope you\u2019re doing well because I\u2019m not. I lost someone who meant very much to me last night and it was from my own doing. My own mistake. And I can\u2019t get over it. I love her so much and she was the best friend I could\u2019ve ever asked for. She would take care of me and make me laugh and smile and could calm me down when I was upset. She would sing to me when times are tough. She thought her singing was bad but it was so beautiful to me. I love her so much and I was so blessed to have her as a friend. Well I made a big mistake last night and I unintentionally hurt her and she was upset and I made some more incredibly large and stupid mistakes that led her to being more upset and she won\u2019t talk to me now at all. I feel terrible. All I can think about is her and I\u2019ve been sobbing all day and earlier I was puking. I\u2019ve also developed even more suicidal thoughts from my already existing ones from my current depression and sadness that isn\u2019t related to her. I just hope she\u2019s doing ok.

I tried suggesting my mother to come to my place of work to work with me (sense I make more) while my dad goes and gets himself a job. So atleast then we would have 3 incomes coming in. She wont have any of it, dosent want to lose her pension and insurance, which I can kind of understand. My father on the other hand wont work with me becuase he has to much pride and dosent want to clean for a living. \n\nI cant do this for much longer and this is the reason I am reaching out.

Somehow even though I've not had a look at one, it just keeps coming to mind. I think it comes to mind the moment I think about her. Where once there was joy and laughter, I now feel sadness and regret. Instead of memories that I look fondly on, I see images that make me want to cry. Why did I give my heart so easily again? Did I completely forget what happened last time? Did I forget the hurt and the pain that had me in toil before? The hurt that made two years go by without me even realising it. How many more years will I have to suffer with this? Why can't I just be content with the friends that I have? Why do I keep making it something more than it should be! Why do I try to awaken that which needs and wants to be left dormant? In any case, I have made up my mind. Never again, I don't want to feel this way again. It's time to pull up the walls and put on the mask. Hide away the pain with jokes and laughter. Suppress the emotions that are clearly just toying with you. Grow up and learn that life isn't some game, it's not a fantasy world with you as it's protagonist. It's a scary place filled with sorrow and suffering. But enough of this, let me go back to the cliff.\nThe image is in the evening just after the sun has set. I stand at the edge of a cliff facing a person I thought I loved. The fall beyond the edge is deep. It's a straight fall into a vast forest filled with acres of trees. All you can see is the greenery from the tops of the trees. But that doesn't mean it'll be a safe landing. You can be assured that a fall will very much result in demise! I peer at this face that once brought joy. Now as I look back, there is some happy thoughts but it keeps getting muddled in a dark colour. It's as if I don't want to remember anything. It's like my brain is blotting away any memories out of existence. Where I once was begging for it to not end, I'm asking to be put out of misery. It's a turn that I could not predict and that I definitely did not expect! As I stand there looking at her, she appears to be saying something to me. The words are all slurred and my brain doesn't make out any words. And then all of a sudden, she nudges me on the shoulder. I lose my balance and slip down the void. It's a long drop and so I have time to gather my thoughts. Why did I ever fall in love again? Why couldn't I just be satisfied with the friends and family I had in my life.

Anxiety and depression don't run as rampant as I am now taking care of myself and am acting on achieving my goals. However, I have a weakness in the form of unviability in the romantic department, despite how \"interesting\" I could ever make myself. This is because I have gynecomastia.  \n\n\nGynecomastia, for those who don't want to take the time Google search it, is feminine breast tissue within males. This, is a *cripplingly* tough barrier for initiating and sustaining romantic interests. It's bizarre, because past rejection has domino effected itself into a defense mechanism. Not only do I immediately become scornful of any girl who flirts with me, but now anybody who displays human decency toward me sets me off into a literal primal attack mode. No longer do I even so much as think of starting conversations with woman I find attractive and/or interesting, or even \"taking it a step further\" with woman whom I may be already acquainted with because I have convinced myself I have a 100% rejection rate. The humiliation is inevitable and unbearable for me. In the freak event I find a girl who is willing to compromise, why should she have to even make the compromise? Just go away and find somebody who can rightfully fulfill your needs.  \n\n\nThe above mentioned it what I believe to be a root cause. The subject matter is too embarrassing to discuss with a councilor, yet alone to a loving family member or one of my handful of decent acquaintances. I'm saying \"decent acquaintances\" because I can't even have what can be considered real friends at this point due to what is becoming of my mental state. I mean, what could they possibly do to solve my problem? They say loneliness is an equivalent smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day, and I believe that. My body is physically ill as I write this, regardless of the stacked circumventing efforts I make to better myself.  \n\n\nKeep in mind I take care of myself. I go to the gym, only drink water (shoutout to the hydrohomies), walk my dog (my is a godsend, can provide dog tax), don't eat garbage food, intermittent fast, get good sleep, act on creative interests,  and am not overweight (I'm 5'11, 155 lbs), therefore, it cannot be fat, fat would show signs of deterioration, it has to be genuine breast tissue from being genetically unfortunate.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T03:39:19+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T03:39:20+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eatxhw/genetically_unfortunate/"}

I live with my parents as I just graduated a few months ago\n    High school ended shitty, I lost my friends because a girl I was dating spread rumors around my super right wing school that I was a furry and that I \u201cdid terrible things.\u201d And \u201cdeserved to die.\u201d  Btw I\u2019m not innocent. I was wish washy and went back to an ex soon after breaking up with her, but she pressured me a lot into desicions about our relationship. Moved it quick. I wanted out. I didn\u2019t cheat though I swear. She believes she is a witch and caused my stomach disease. Weird I know, I learned it from a friend who left me to be her friend after he recently reached out to me. \n   Now I\u2019m not a furry but that is besides that point. The friends I had left me not only because of the rumors but some of them for the girls that were perpetuating the stuff that was ruining my social life. \n   All of the while; as though that were not enough, I become extremely ill. Spasms, general pain and swelling in the intestines accompanied by daily rectal tearing, diarrhea, extreme gas and gastric pain accompanied by swelling, mucus in my stool, black stool, and nausea, vomiting, and general lack of sleep, (talking 2-4 good hours, then I wake up having to toss or pee or barf every 30 mins to an hour). \n   It gets so bad that I have to go to the hospital and get all kinds of pills and scans and treatments and they still can\u2019t tell me what it is or how to fix it. I owe a lot let\u2019s just leave it at that. Enough to where I\u2019m not going to try to think about school (college).\n   So after all that I say, \u201cokay it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be the good guy and move on.\u201d So I did. I graduate, get a cool climbing job at a summer camp running a ropes course with a friend, but I\u2019m constantly reminded of my weak body by the pain and spasms and snotty poop and the terrible noises in the night. Or the constant discomfort in the car. The fact that I can\u2019t work at least once a week physically and the fact that I get sick for a flare up that can last a week or more.\n   But at least at camp I have friends. The doctors also gave me news that I had to lower my diet to cut out oils, fats, red meat, fruit with skins, high fiber veggies, artificial flavors, lactose, white bread, carbonation, and other things, and I lost 25 lbs in a month.\n   However I still felt okay. I liked my job and was well supported by my community. I had a very active faith life as well that kept me afloat, but then the summer ended...and my car broke down...and I came back home with my parents whom I love dearly, don\u2019t mistake me, but they can be nagging and reminding of the harder things, or hurtful things. My friends have also vanished. \n   It\u2019s hard to keep in touch. I just can\u2019t get the courage to text that often. I feel annoying, or maybe I\u2019m not really interested. I don\u2019t really know anymore. All the while it feels like my insides are melting, my debt is piling up, my hours at my job are shrinking and it feels like the only time I have fun is with my only friend who I hold close. \n   At work my coworkers are trying to get me to fuck a girl that they know as a friend because we are both lonely. I find this degrading and it only pushes me further down into this darkness that I feel inside. I don\u2019t even think about women sexually anymore, or men. The most I want is a romance. \n   I can\u2019t fix my car because my hours are small because I keep getting sick because I can\u2019t go to the hospital because I can\u2019t afford to because I can\u2019t work.

I also wanted to get a part time job, but I had no luck in that department. I decided to enroll at college, not because I wanted to, but because I was bored. It's drilled into me that if I don't go to college, I'll never be successful. I felt useless at home because I couldn't get hired for even basic entry level retail positions - in order to get a job, you need experience, but to get experience, you need a job. Cue an endless loop of not getting hired. I did well my first semester and got straight A's, but I didn't enjoy any of my classes. I have no idea what I want to major in. I have no idea what I like or what my career should be. When I was a kid I always dreamed I would create content (writing books, directing movies, making music, acting, etc.) but my creative spirit and my confidence have been completely crushed by years of trauma.

Everyone else my age and younger seems to have a general idea about what they're passionate about or where they'd like to go, but I'm nearing 21 and I have absolutely no fucking idea. I never got the chance to explore any of this stuff when I was a teenager because I was too busy trying to survive. I feel so worthless, and it's even worse since I can't even land a part time job. I've been trying to find at least something almost nonstop but I haven't had any luck. It's not that I act unpleasant or impolite - most people are shocked to find out I'm depressed because I act so confident and extroverted. But it's all just bullshit, I think about dying constantly lately. I don't know what's wrong with me. Is this all I'm ever going to amount to?

I keep getting blamed and receiving consequences for doing the right thing and the douchey people who are disrespectful to me get away scot-free. My family who used to be more supportive are not supporting me emotionally at all, even though they say they are. Instead they're making things worse. My friends who used to be there for me have either completely abandoned me for reasons I don't understand, or they just don't care/don't want to hear about my issues/don't want to help. I'm dealing with PTSD issues from being bullied at two work places and am terrified to work while meanwhile eating through my savings.\n\n I no longer can trust anyone after being burnt so many times and that means a significant other is out of the question. It also means kids are out of the question since I know I wouldn't be able to handle raising them alone, plus my energy level and mental state isn't good enough for raising kids. I had always wanted kids, so that's hurting me, but the lack of love on ALL accounts is hurting me more. I used to feel very loved by family and friends and now I don't at all. I promise I have always been a kind, caring, respectful person, so it's extremely unfair and nonsensical. \n\nI've finally learned to assert myself when people are not respecting me, yet my feelings never matter and I end up being reamed out and painted as the douchebag when in reality the other person is the douchebag. I've tried over and over thinking oh this is just a fluke, but it's now the norm and I just can't handle it anymore. I'm youngish, but the thought of going through decades more of this stuff just isn't possible. I've been depressed for the past 6 years, severely depressed for the past almost year, tried so many meds and dosages and combos (over 20 years of being depressed/anxious off and on), and none of them work for me, have no support in my life besides my therapist, so at least I have her, but my life is otherwise a dumpster fire that can't improve. My family and friends won't suddenly come back and be supportive. This is just the way it is now.\n\nAlso I have health issues now FROM being so depressed and anxious and that scares the shit out of me because one issue (now in just the \"pre\" phase) is very serious and I would not be able to deal with it. It would kill me either figuratively or literally or both. Suicide isn't an option for me because I get too scared and chicken out and don't want to scare people by having them find my body. I'm not ungrateful-- I say thank you every day for all I have and things would be far worse if I had no shelter, food, clothes, etc although with my money running out I'm worried about that happening and have no energy to prepare proper meals anyway. \n\nI've had to put on a happy face whenever I go out and just hold it in when people say rude things to me and disregard my boundaries, since asserting myself doesn't work, but it's getting to the point where I just can't do it anymore. I'm in weekly therapy, but at this point I haven't improved because I keep getting hurt for reasons that don't make sense to me (developing PTSD from being bullied at work, being abandoned by my best friend who recently promised she would never abandon me, etc) and things just keep going downhill.

It's finals season right now and studying for some meaningless test seems so stupid when I don't even really want to live.\n\nI've started medication, and sometimes I feel okay. When I'm not thinking anything, when I'm not really feeling, I'm okay. But then when I realize things, when I understand and compare my life to others, when I stand in such stark contrast to those who are happy and have a community and friends to support them, I go back into this hole of depression. I only ever have small moments of happiness, moments when I'm with the few people who love me and whom I love. But it's difficult to depend on people when I don't have many friends in the first place and I constantly feel lonely. I see those around me who are always surrounded by people, always being sought, who are liked and known amongst people. I compare myself as someone who is a loner, who has exactly 4 friends to spend time with at school.\n\nIt's difficult because it's like at what point is it circumstance or can I change those circumstances. I feel like it's so difficult to make connections or find a community for myself. I thought if I went to an Ivy I would be happy. I went to Harvard, and have never been more depressed in my life. I thought if I were to be in a relationship I would be happy. My boyfriend is so loving and kind and so supportive (albeit long distance). I am still so so sad, I feel his happy life in such stark contrast to mine. He has so many friends, a tight knit community, he likes being at school. I am alone at school. I hate being there. I have nowhere to go. Now I feel like I've become even more depressed because someone else's happiness and better social life have been shoved in my face.\n\nI'm aware this sounds incredibly whiny. I feel like I gave up on trying to make friends or meet people after freshman year. I tried, and many people just weren't interested in extending the relationship. I feel like my current friends are going to become numb to my pain and constant gloominess. I've had many friends this year just stop hanging out with me b/c they got happier and I didn't. I feel like I've become numb to feeling so depressed - I've cried every week this semester. But I'm not crying now. I feel so numb, and I've almost accepted the fact that if I had many things I desired I would still feel depressed. Then what's the point of living right? At this point I'm living for others, because I don't want to ruin my family's life.

Although I fit in with adults much better than I do with teenagers. \nI am in trade school for diesel tech, while also working as a diesel mechanic about 30 hours a week and put a tremendous amount of time into online diesel engine training courses at home. That pretty much sums up my day to day life.  \nJust about 2 months ago, I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant with my baby. That was the first time in my life I have ever felt true happiness. I didn't give a fuck what anybody in the world thought. I was happy.\nFor about 2 weeks.\nI was at school, when my girlfriend called me and told me she was having a miscarriage. I then had to go to work right after school. I saw her for about an hour that night and cried it out. Then I went home to my parents telling me they don't want me to see her anymore, or talk to her at all, now that there was no baby in the picture. I'm 17, so I really don't have too much say. \nI then told my parents about my emotional state, about how my whole life that I have been depressed and emotionless. And that this baby was the only thing that ever gave me happiness. They themselves did not show any care, except for putting me back into counselling. I was then diagnosed with depression and ocd. I have been taking 20mg of citalopram for about 3 weeks. And I have become even more depressed and emotionless.\nAll I can think about is how I wish that I could still have my baby. \nI have always been suicidal, ever since I was like 8, 9 years old. I am getting closer and closer to the edge, where every day that passes, suicide begins to seem more and more rational. \nI suffered brain damage as a baby and it had rewired my brain. I am still a normal person, as you could guess by me getting honor roll in my diesel technology class and being a pretty damn good diesel mechanic at only 17 years old, and maintaining a job as a mechanic. I'm a rapper and have been told I write some of the best lyrics anybody has ever heard, I have gotten quite a bit of recognition for my music, given that it is very depressing and violent music, such as performing in many big cities around me and getting recognized by many musicians that I look up to, as well as making a little money from my music.\nSo it's not that I'm mentally retarted or anything.

I'll admit that I haven't used Reddit much at all. This post may be a bit of a mess, but I really need to get this all off of my chest.\n\nI'm 18, currently in high school. I'm taking 6/8 classes currently, and am stressed out of my mind. I've spent most of my free time working on homework, and have started to find that I don't even enjoy doing anything that I used to. I've also found myself zoning out a lot more than usual, while working on homework, talking to people, or similar. Most of my classes are normal classes, except my AP art class.\n\nOn top of all of the work I've been assigned, some of my teachers haven't exactly been the nicest to me. I can only really think of a few examples at the moment.. They aren't all 100% related to my issues, but I think they may be contributing. Feel free to skip over them.\n- I had turned an art project in a day late because I was sick the day before. We had just recently went to a different state, and I'm assuming I caught something there. This teacher assumed that I was trying to get more time, and proceeded to dock me 10%. It doesn't seem like a huge deal, but I had worked so hard to get that assignment in on time. I tried to talk to her about it, and she went on about how most workplaces won't give you sick pay. After this I tried to ask her why another assignment had been docked. I had drawn this hawk/rattlesnake hybrid in grasslands lunging at another combined creature I made prior. She said that it wasn't lunging, and that the background wasn't giving her enough info (I poured my heart and soul into this piece). I'm convinced that she didn't look into the piece, or considered what I may have been trying to do.\n- I had made a video for my American history project, and was trying to set up to present. I was struggling to set up, and tried to ask her about the document I shared with her because it has a link to the video. I was thinking that would be better than logging in to my google account and maybe messing her stuff up (because I have a tendency to mess up under pressure). She has misunderstood, and was going through another stack of unrelated papers looking for mine. I told her that wasn't it and that I would figure it out, and she had ended up throwing the stack of papers on the floor. Then, while I was setting up, I heard her very sarcastically say \"really?\" I had thought she was talking to me, and told her that I didn't log out of her account.. To which she responded, just as or more sarcastically, \"not you, [name].\"\n&gt; I have the same teacher for world history and American history. I was going to be missing on of the final days for one of the classes, and needed to remember to talk to her about it. I have a bad memory, so I wanted to mention it during a period she gave us to work because I knew I was going to forget. When I mentioned it to her, she sarcastically said \"how's about we talk about it during that class?\" I forgot during that class, and wasn't able to talk to her about it.\n\nThis little stuff seriously got to me, and I've found myself crying over some of the little things my teachers have said and done.\n\nI also feel like my class tends to avoid me. I'm a bit quiet, and I have slightly different interests than everyone else. I'm not sure if I've done something to make them dislike me or what. I'll try to talk to people, and things will seem fine until they start to ignore me. I've found myself sitting by myself in some of my senior classes. I'm not getting bullied, but I don't understand why people are ignoring me. I've had people gossip about me in other schools in the past, so I can't help but feel like that could be the case now.\n\nThe friends that I do currently have I'm unsure about. Two of them only hang out with each other now, and will occasionally talk to me. However it feels like they've both sort of pushed me away. The other friend who is still around is a compulsive liar. She had told me that another student had said she wanted to kill me, and that she wanted to stab me. This was partially true, but blown way out of proportion. I had gotten the principal involved and they had investigated. My friend had told me that I was blowing things out of proportion and creating stress for the whole friend group (which I wasn't?)..\n\nI do have a few online friends, but I feel like I've made myself unwelcome. Within that friend group, I have a boyfriend (woo LDRs..). He hates listening to me vent, so every now and then I'll try to talk to some of the others about my issues. It.. Seems like that's upset people, so I'm going to try to avoid that in the future.\n\nOn top of everything else, I can't seem to eat right. I never feel hungry, I'm constantly stressed and anxious, and it's fantastic. My mom is a nurse, and keeps telling me that I'm distracting myself from eating, and that my computer is the issue. The thing is that I just don't feel hungry. Everyone else I know who uses their computers as regularly as I do feels hungry, but I just don't seem to normally. My mom keeps blaming this on me, and refuses to really listen. It always turns into a fight.\n\nI've tried to talk to her about my stress and anxiety, and she says that it's all normal. I feel like it isn't, because I think it's causing a lot of the issues I'm having currently. She refuses to let my talk to a doctor or therapist, or at least has been strongly advising against it. She's a Christian, and has been telling me that I just need to pray about it.\n\nMy parents are also divorced. I've had to deal with either parent talking crap about the other, and being told to keep it to myself. I'm told to keep a lot of stuff from the other parent in general, and I've gotten to this point where I just let everything bottle up over time.\n\nThere's so much stuff that's been building up over time and I feel like I'm starting to become depressed. I don't know exactly how all of this works, and I've been told that I'm not so many times. I've been told that everything I'm going through is normal but I can't help but feel like it isn't.\n\nIf I've broken any rules here, I'm so sorry.. I made sure to read through them all, but I'm never sure.

I don\u2019t even know, what holds me here. \n\nMy childhood was cleaning the house and taking care about 20 horses, every day. \nNo matter how clean the house was, when my mom came home, she instantly made it dirty again. Seriously... I never became any love from both of my parents. My mother punished me every day, like hitting me with kitchen utensils and broomsticks and a whip. Till they broke or I was crying of pain. I had almost no friends and got bullied in school because I always came late or was \u201eill\u201c. Then actually I was cleaning the stable. When I had pain somewhere or I really got ill, my mother just said \u201edon\u2019t cry and stfu\u201c. \nThen, with 16 I was brave enough to go to the youth office and they brought me to an children\u2019s home which wasn\u2019t that better either. \nI don\u2019t have any contact to my mother and I don\u2019t want to. The rest of my family never call me or something but complains about me that I never call them or come to visit them. Which isn\u2019t true. \nI failed in Highschool (I guess that\u2019s the name for it in English?) and wasn\u2019t able to study. \nWhich was also the fault of my extremely jealous ex gf. She wanted to kill herself once because I needed a brake. \nThen my next ex gf cheated on me. \nNow I\u2019m in education with depressions. Sometimes I can\u2019t get out of my bed and go to school. I talked to my instructor and told him about my depression. It\u2019s a bit weird now when we talk to each other... \nNobody in my company really talks to me and for me it feels like I\u2019m an alien to them. Idk \nIm totally stressed out right now because everyone is complaining about me or don\u2019t want to talk to me more than just a few sentences. \nI just feels like nobody likes me and I\u2019m feeling totally ugly. \n\nSometimes I notice of myself when I did something, I\u2019m kinda seeking for confirmation from someone to be thankful.

I talked to the mushrooms and set an intention to be a better man and asked them to help me figure a way out of wage slavery. I sat in a dark room blindfolded with earplugs. I don't remember much of what I experienced but some of the things I can recall were scary faces learing at me, strange noises, a feeling of a malovent presence, and a seperate feeling of an alien presence. At the same time though I felt like I was safe.\n\nAfter that I went to the next room and laid down with my girlfreind and watched tv. She is the love of my life and we had a great relationship. I recall that some people on the tv looked like aliens and others were artificial like robots. At some point I blacked out but continued to talk to her. The mushrooms told her that I have been going to massage parlors and recieving handjobs and that I have urges to have sex with other women. She forgave me and we moved on. \n\nSince that day I have been microdosing and I feel like a normal person for the first time in my life. I am no longer suicidal. I am optimistic, more social, and more sympathetic to others. I feel connected to other humans. I am working on starting my own buissness that will inrich myself and others. I am repairing burnt bridges. I now have goals and dreams.\n\nI have been a deadbeat dad. I have been ducking my child support. I have a son I haven't seen or spoke to in well over a year. A few nights ago I reached out to his mother and asked her for forgiveness. It was so hard but we ended up talking and laughing for three hours and she forgave me. When I have my life together I will reconnect with my him.\n\nToday I went to a massage parlor and was offered oral sex. I didn't turn it down because I wanted it. Then I asked for sex and  I got it. I am beyond ashamed. I am ashamed that this will break my girlfreinds heart and destroy our relationship. And I am ashamed for participating in human trafficking. Afterwards I thought maybe I could do some good and asked her if she was a victim of this and if she needed help. She laughed and assured me she wasn't but I have my doubts. I recognize that I am a sex addict and will be seeking professional help. \n\nI want to be open and honest. I want to be true to myself and others about what I am. I want to get better.\n\nPsilocybin for me added something that I have been missing my entire life and I feel whole now. It's like coming out of a fog into the sunshine. I believe it is natural medicine and not a drug. If you decide to go down this path I encourage you to do some research on your own and make sure you have a trip sitter.\n\nThis is my testimonial and I hope it does some good.\n\nTonight I will show this post to my girlfreind.", "created_utc": "2019-12-15T01:14:58+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-15T01:14:58+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eascij/if_you_are_at_the_end_of_your_rope_consider_using/"}

I don't know if I still do or not.  I have the memories from when I was a child of being at my grandparents on Christmas Eve, looking out the window of my grandpa's bedroom towards my house with my cousins, watching to see if Santa and his reindeer came.  It's so funny remembering that we were all so gullible as my dad and uncle left to check on something, but in reality they were putting presents under the tree.  When we'd get home we were so excited to see the presents that santa dropped off that we BEGGED to open them not caring that Christmas was a sleep away.  Then going to church the next morning and whispering to our cousins during prayer to find out what they got for Christmas.  It filled me up with so much warmth, I loved getting together with my family and enjoying the company they'd bring... I'd love hearing the stories I've heard so many times before because my uncle's don't remember that they told the story before.  I don't know what happened, maybe I grew out of it... Maybe I got too cynical.  One year I was loving Christmas and the next year it was just another day.  It happened long before I moved out of my childhood home, long before I lost my mom.  Christmas stopped having the magic for me.  I'm sad that I don't feel the same way, I want to be filled with the joy I had when I was a kid.  I try to have the holiday cheer that I used to, but in reality I don't feel anything.  The day will pass and everything will move on to the next big thing.

I was very close with my father who passed away suddenly just a few years ago. My mother was always a narcissist since I was a little girl, constantly cheating on my dad even though he took care of her and treated her well. She was never emotionally available for me, always very self absorbed, etc. Right after my dad passed away, she moved across the country to be with a wealthy man who could be her father and pretty much left me to rot. I've gone no contact with her, along with my sister who is the splitting image of my mother. As lonely as it is, it hurts more having them in the picture. So, being with family is out of the question. \n\nIt gets worse! I moved in with my abusive boyfriend after my mom sold the house right after my father died. It was so sudden, I didn't even have time to save for a place of my own. When I say my boyfriend is abusive, I mean both physically and mentally. I'm trying to get a job but my license expired and he dictates me to the extreme, so I've been pretty secluded from the world and have no money of my own. Or friends. \n\nI'll be honest, I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and fight to keep my head above water every day. I know it sounds pretty hopeless, but does anyone have any advice?

If I was half a second faster coming out from behind that bus I was dead or half a second slower it would have missed me altogether.\nThat happened two weeks into secondary school, after that I began to question everything; life, death, religion, family, friends, everything. Not long after that began the five continuous years of verbal bullying witch I just accepted thinking that I deserved it. And during this time my teeth began to chip away which just added to my self confidence being destroyed.\nAfter leaving school I entered into a routine of working 10 to 12 hours in a shitty hotel coming ng home getting really stoned playing games for a few hours and going to bed thinking about suicide. This went on few about 6 or 7 years.\nThe last year or 2 has been better as I have a new job and can see a future for myself and no longer think about suicide but I still think about death regularly.

Please.", "author": "Phyloseum", "selftext": "This is going to be lengthy. It will probably be boring. It will probably be hard to understand. But I will try my absolute hardest to explain what's been going on.\n\nHere in the last month or so, things have no gone well. My parents basically have split and will divorce soon. I'm nearly 19 years old and have no idea what to do with my life. I'm unemployed, living with my mother and 3 other siblings. I'm having serious health problems going on. None of us have really have an income right now, we're piss poor broke, and we have no insurance. \n\nLet me explain how this happened.\n\n\nFor the last year, there's been alot of serious relationship issues between my parents. They basically have fought none stop since I was around 2, and they've split once, but managed to work it out until now. It got to the point to where they didn't even acknowledge eachother, and anything said resulted in a fight. My mother got tired of everything, and within a few weeks she began packing things around the house and basically told me I had a choice. And I mean a life decision choice. I could either stay with my father, or I could go with her and my 3 siblings to where we used to live. Knowing that she couldn't support everyone, let alone pay rent, I went with her. I still don't know if this was a mistake. \n\nWe moved from Kentucky back to Florida, meaning we are over 800 miles away from my father. I was expecting a change in pace moving back here (we lived here before) but in all honesty nothing has worked out. We've lived here for about 4 weeks now, and despite being separated and soon to be divorced, my parents still fight over the phone. My dad wants to talk to the younger kids, but they just can't work their shit out. They then left it up to ME to hold the family together and make sure that everyone talks to him, but I just couldn't deal with that. Things still haven't worked out between them, but after me explaining that I do not want to be apart of that, my mother reluctantly took back the responsibility.\n\nI have a job interview soon, but I am completely broke. My mother is as well, and makes about $100 a week from doing eBay stuff, and that's simply not enough. I've agreed to help pay up to $400 in rent (basically water, electric, and wifi bills added up) and help out with groceries on occasion. But for the moment, that's not possible.\n\nWe have no insurance either, and I suffer from horrible asthma and horrible eczema. I desperately need my inhaler and ointment, but simply cannot pay. I was able to spend the last of my money on one inhaler and a small tube of ointment, and both are about to run out. \n\nOur house is constantly a mess because nobody wants to clean it up. And I won't lie, I don't either. It's the same shit each day. Messy ass house, and once it gets cleaned it's dirty again right after.\n\nAll 3 of my siblings are just unbearable to be living with. I'm the only guy in this house, and it's me being surrounded by my mother and 2 asshole sisters. My brother is just 2, so I can't really consider him anything. I'm 18, the oldest sister is 15, youngest is 11. The 15 year old gets better treatment than I do. I don't know why, she's an absolute shithead and I guess it's because she's adjusted to this situation better than me.\n\nI don't have a driver's licence yet. So I can't really go out when I like, not that I could anyway. I'm expected to babysit on a daily basis since I don't have a job yet. It's been the same cycle for almost 4 weeks. \n\nI don't have many friends here. Most of the ones I had have moved on, and the few that are still with me are living their lives and have their own shit going on. So even if I wanted to go out, I have nobody to hang with. Being stuck in this house almost every.single.day is absolutely unbearable.\n\nI won't lie, I haven't been myself for a good two weeks. I've been wondering to myself if it was worth it to come down here. Should I have stayed up there with my father? Should I have just gone my own route? I don't know. I'm an adult now and I don't know how to handle this. It's really getting to me. I tell my mother this, and she goes on to tell me how easy I have it, and how I'm not neglected. Which I understand. I do have a roof over my head and food to eat. But home doesn't even feel like home anymore. I don't want to be here, but I have to be here. I don't really do anything now but just lay in bed. Even when I'm not tired, I'm still tired. I've been like this for a few days. My mom's now threating to kick me out if I don't become productive. I just don't know what to do anymore.\n\nIt's not easy being dragged down by the weight of the stone. I'm starting to wonder if it's just me or if it's everyone else. Am I just ungrateful? Am I entitled? Do I have it easy? Am I the one who's to blame? I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't even know. I really don't.

For those interested in the back story: \n\nMy dad has been addicted to alcohol as long as I can remember. When he drank he would get aggressive. My mom, younger brother and me would flee out of the house and spend one or more nights in the car, I\u2019ve spend nights in the street aswell. \n\nJust before I went to college my parents divorced. I hoped things would get better but they didn\u2019t. My dad promised to sober up but his addiction got worse. My mom and brother don\u2019t speak to him anymore, neither do my uncles and aunts. I\u2019m the only one who still looks after him. After the divorce my mom got severly depressed and my younger brother dropped out of school and spends his nights outside the house doing god knows what. This means I\u2019ve been doing most of the housekeeping like cooking and cleaning. Combining this with working parttime and going to college broke me. \n\nI\u2019ve always been chased by anxiety, depression and lonliness but always managed to escape. This time those feelings won. I\u2019ve stopped going to classes since october. Before I stopped I got an internship at a big company, everybody keeps telling me I should be so proud and happy but I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m supposed to start in february and I am serouisly considering to cancel it. I\u2019ve always had good grades and really want to get my bachelors degree to make my parents proud and provide a happy moment for my family, but atm i just can\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve always been the \u2018funny guy\u2019 in school. Eventhough i didn\u2019t have any real friends, i was good at connecting to other people. I\u2019m losing that know, i\u2019ve noticed communicating with others is getting harder for me and I even started stuttering. \nAt night I have feelings of anxiety. My dad moved out of the house 3,5 years ago. But with every sound I hear at night, I think it\u2019s him who\u2019s drunk. As a result I start breathing heavy or scream for help. \nDuring the day i go the work. It feels good, but when i\u2019m not at work I get feelings of depression and loneliness. I feel like i\u2019m losing myself and i don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nAt the moment, the only positive thing in my life is my gf. She\u2019s the sweetest girl ever. Unfortunatly she was raised by very conservative and religious parents. Wich means she can\u2019t have a boyfriend. So we keep our relationship a secret. We\u2019ve been in a four year relationship, and the only way we ever could \u2018freely\u2019 be together is if I convert or she decides to leave her family for me. I know this is an unhealthy situation and it may be best for both of us to break up. It\u2019s just that I really love her and she\u2019s the only person who really gets me, since i don\u2019t have any friends. \n\nAnd that brings me here. It\u2019s saturday night, everyone is having fun with their friends. Meanwhile I\u2019m here, sitting in a car at a empty parking lot just drowning in my thoughts.

I'm really sorry about the long read, you can skip the \"background\" to get to the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:** I am a 26-year-old male who has been struggling with depression/suicide for many years. (Diagnosed with severe depression in 2012 with two suicide attempts in 2015 and 2016). Every type of antidepressant I have tried has just made things worse. Therapists haven't really helped either as they usually just insist on me going on \"suicide watch\". I thought I had a pretty good handle on things, but recently, I am in serious trouble. I have severe sleep apnea, which I use a Bipap machine for, and I was diagnosed with narcolepsy (an incurable and degenerative disease), which has completely turned my life upside down as my condition gets worse and worse (it's increasingly difficult to stay awake). This has affected my ability to work as a mechanical engineer (I sometimes have to leave work early because I'm too tired or I'm on the verge of tears of frustration). I have been using prescribed adderall to keep me awake and to become numb to my depression along with weed to help me sleep and to go to bed \"happy\". I recently found out that a bunch of employees including the CEO and the head of HR have been constantly making fun of me for having to leave early even though I finish my work at night. They even refused a raise for me so I'm still living paycheck-to-paycheck. I live in an apartment in San Francisco with 3 other people who don't understand what I'm going through and who keep trashing the place, despite me asking them to help clean, which is significantly affecting my mood especially since I have OCD. Working out has been a huge help since it's directly correlated to my happiness, but because of the narcolepsy I'm getting too tired to keep at it, and I know it's only going to get worse. The narcolepsy/depression has also made it more difficult to maintain a social life - I have lost interest in dating and now my \"best friends\" won't even invite me to hang out with them anymore.\n\n**Summary:** In summary, I'm stuck in a toxic work environment, in a toxic living environment, my family and I are not close at all, my friends are leaving me, traditional depression treatments don't work, my working out therapy is failing, I'm essentially doomed because of narcolepsy, and I have officially lost the will to live. The difference between now and the previous two suicide attempts is that I have thought and rationalized this for the past two years and I am quite content with it as I fail to see the point to continue on living especially if my condition will just get worse and worse. Every single day is so difficult to get through, I truly hate myself and my situation, and I've never wanted to consistently end my life so badly. I plan on going out like a retired sports player by quitting my job, donating my money, deleting my social media accounts, finishing my already-started will, then ending it underneath the stars (astronomy is my most favorite thing).\n\n**Assistance:** Before I choose to die, I want to make one last effort at the start of 2020. This includes finding a therapist who specializes in narcoleptic patients, completely quitting adderall and weed, aggressively job searching that hopefully leads to better pay so I can move out of this apartment, and forcing myself to workout every day. If you guys have any suggestions on mood trackers, therapeutic tips like the \"cold shower method\", or anything else to help me in my last pursuit of happiness, I would be forever grateful. Please, help me. There's a little bit of me that's not ready to die yet.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T22:22:25+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T22:22:26+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 7, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaqav7/i_need_your_help_for_my_hopefully_not_final_push/"}

I go to college and I have food and shelter, logically I should not feel self pity and hatred but it just seeps up sometimes. I don't  even know why it happens and what it is tht I did wrong because it could be something as small as someone taking too long to respond, I'm a rational adult and I know there are things tht actually matter but it just fucks with my head so much sometimes and sometimes nothing bothers me like I hate tht im so bipolar sometimes and I hate admitting it. I used to live with my mom who was bipolar, I love her but I was tht kid who just knew when to not fk with her cuz I could just sense it. her being abusive and then turn loving the next day like nothing happened the day bfr was fucked up I always thought I wouldn't turn into that I kept telling myself since forever and I made sure I did everything i can and took every turn to not turn into tht person but everyday it just feels like I'm becoming more and more into her as I grow. It feels like the one thing tht I'm trying to outrun always catches up to me. I didn't even notice it until my gf pointed it out tht I'm a fkd up person and im terrible with my feelings and I don't know how to handle myself. It just fkn sucks that my life is like a wave and I have no control over it. It feels like my curves going down again and I just want to not go there cuz idk if I can handle it long enough for it go up. These days I feel like some parts of me are missing and idk how to find em, it always starts like this and slowly I just become more and more dead and become a zombie and move until I can't anymore and just stay in my room and starve and never get outta bed, wake up at 3 pm and can't wait to go back to bed and have random panic attacks, pushing ppl who actually care about me, ruin my work and classes. The worst part is the last time it happened I didn't have anyone. This time I have a gf who loves me but I just can't seem to be able to tell her. We talked about this, we cried, we agreed that id tell her about my feelings but I just can't seem to shake this feeling that I don't deserve her and she deserves better than my self pity and the one thing worse than depression is watching how your depression affect ppl tht u love.....I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe it's a cry for help or I just need something to hang onto so I don't fall into tht pit.

{"id": "eaq7cs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/eaq7cs/the_mountain/", "title": "The Mountain", "author": "Emptyreliquary", "selftext": "  \n\nI have seen the mountain near and far since I was a small child. We moved close to it when I was younger and since then I have lived varying distances from it. From afar it is part of the scenery, certainly not the only mountain in the local terrain. Up close it can be terrifying. It is dark, almost black, craggy and bare. It is large and ominous. It does not appear impossible to climb, though it does look like it would take days, maybe weeks\u2026 however as you approach it, what look like hand and foot holds seem instead, sharp and unforgiving. I was told when I was younger that there is a path; a long, winding path that tests even those well-trained. Basically, it is not insurmountable but the spirit reacts as if it so. \n\nBeing this close to it, the logical respect I have for it is replaced by an overwhelming, unforgiving fear.\n\nHe wants me to climb it. A major is staring at a petty recruit in this moment. He is telling the recruit to climb the mountain. That recruit is me and my legs are shaking.\n\nIn truth, I have excelled in many aspects of training. I have begrudgingly earned his respect or so I had fathomed and hoped. I truly admire him, he is well put together, skilled, and never raises his voice. He is always in control and even when he says forceful things his volume is soft and controlled. Even now his casual words cut through me like a knife as he tells me to climb the mountain. \n\n\u201cClimb the mountain.\u201d  \n   \n \u201cSir, I cannot climb that mountain, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not recruit,\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause sir, my legs will not move and I have no strength in my arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cClimb the mountain, recruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026I cannot\u2026.\u201d My voice falters, my chest and fingertips buzzing, and it feels as if a weight is sitting in my stomach.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cI cannot make my body move. I am very ill. The clouds are rolling in and its going to rain, the rocks will be slick. If I climb the mountain I may die on that mountain.\u201d 'Please don\u2019t ask this of me,' I silently add.\n\nHe replies matter-of-factly, \u201cYou need to move your body like you have so many times before. You can not guess the weather but even so, wind and rain will not kill you. If the rocks become slick, grab them harder, take more care. You will not die on that mountain, so go climb the mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I cannot climb that mountain. You see a whole person but in truth, sir, my legs have just fallen off, my arms are following\u2026wait\u2026 there they went too. I am just a torso and a head.\u201d\n\nHe shows no sympathy, he does not acknowledge what I have said. He looks at me and I can see he sees me whole. Arms in place, legs holding me up.\n\n\u201cClimb the mountain. I just want you to climb the mountain. You need to climb the mountain.\u201d\n\nHis eyes seem unflinching. He once congratulated me on my accomplishments and now I feel that if I do not climb the mountain, he will judge me as insufficient. I know I cannot climb the mountain and so I get mad. I get mad at his impossible proposal. The truth is, I want to climb the mountain. It has been terrifying me since I was a child.\n\n\u201cSir, how did you do it. How did you climb that mountain?\u201d\n\nHe does not answer me.\n\n\u201cSurely you have climbed it, you must know how, can\u2019t you teach me if you are so sure I can climb it, can\u2019t you train me?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\u201cThis is your mountain to climb. I never had a need to climb this mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026that can\u2019t be true.\u201d I say. Its looming right over us, its huge.\n\n\u201cMy mountain was different,\u201d he says, \u201cIt was not this difficult for me. You just put one foot in front of the other, you keep going till it is climbed.\u201d\n\nDeep down I know if he had climbed his own mountain it had not been easy for him but its important to him to appear different from me, stronger, not troubled by my fear of heights and physical inadequacies. I can feel the disparity between us.\n\nI am crying now, I cannot wipe my eyes, my arms of course laying on the ground next to me.\n\n\u201cRecruit, are you an adult? Stop crying and climb that mountain. It will make a true soldier out of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I climb that mountain then I will be above you and then I will be on the other side of the mountain away from you,\u201d I say angrily.\n\nI had not realized until that moment the implication of me climbing the mountain. His lack of empathy makes me want to put the mountain in between us. If I climb the mountain I can keep going afterwards, away from him. That would teach him, would it not? \n\nEven as I realize all this, I also realize he is trying to make me stronger and better. He is trying to make a proper soldier out of me , force me to be someone who can take care of themselves. This somehow hurts me to know.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a mountain-climbing training course, apparently, to speak to an expert. Maybe take some supplements while you train and then you will be able to.\u201d He advises.  \n   \n \u201cBut you want me to climb it now. I cannot go be trained and climb it now at the same time,\u201d I state, bewildered.\n\n\u201cYou still need to climb the mountain.\u201d He replies, not responding to the clash of the concepts and their timeline. \n\n\u201cI tried to climb that mountain before,\u201d I say softly realizing my arms and legs have in fact been attached the whole time.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child and several times since then. I kept falling and each time I got injured worse. I fear that mountain to my very core, I believe it is the thing that will kill me.\u201d I have laid my terror bare for him so he can understand.\n\n\u201cYou need to climb that mountain, recruit.\u201d He says once more.\n\n\u201cAnd if it kills me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut I cannot shake this fear and every time he tells me to climb the mountain, I feel more and more ashamed that I cannot even move a step towards it. Even though I see him, I start to wonder if the mountain has moved between us already.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, \u201cI love you and I\u2019m scared and I\u2019m ashamed that something is wrong with me, that a mountain lives in my mind and I cannot overcome it. I feel like I am losing the fact that you love me for who I am.\u201d I do not know if I say these words or if he understands the ones that come out. They are always too many, always conditioned with too much emotion, the tone off-putting, the display of my internal tension probably repulsive.\n\nIt is silent and he reaches a hand to me across the bed in the dark. He takes my hand and softly caresses it.\n\n\u201cI just want you to calm down. I just want you to be better,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cClimb the mountain,\u201d the Major says again.\n\nThe lowly recruit cannot but now knows that no excuse will be accepted, nothing in the situation will change and the best they can do is to remain silent about why they cannot climb the mountain. The argument is circular after all. \n\nIf I can walk to the mountain, if I can start to climb it just a little, just enough to find a spot where I will fall apart in secret then that may satisfy him that I did the thing he needs me to do. Better I suffer then I make him hit his head against a wall trying to make me do what he needs me to so we can be together the way we want. I may go and hide there in that dark, fearful place, where I may be crushed by falling rocks and trapped in the mountain I cannot climb. If I can just get my legs to move.\n\nWritten by: K.L White \n\nI had a bad morning and wrote this and wanted to share it with those who will understand.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T22:14:42+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T22:14:43+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaq7cs/the_mountain/"}

Have been clinically depressed since about 19 after my dad died and got 1000x worse as it effected my schooling. I moved to live at home and finish up my last 3 semesters of school. I struggled with school more than anything and was about to give up for good or just kms. But last May I finally got the right meds and my life slowly started getting back on track. \n\nBut my mom still just sees me as a depressed piece of shit with no plan or any idea how the world works. In the last 6 months I have lost 30lbs, took my last final to get my bachelors degree literally 2 days ago after 6.5 years in school with the best grades I\u2019ve ever gotten. Keep in mind just about a month ago, I had a 35% in 2 classes. (Tried to tell her and she said \u201cyou\u2019re not over worked, that\u2019s life get used to it) So I talked to teachers, got help. And got them both up to 85% . I was feeling the best I ever have. I was proud of my accomplishments and hard work and excited to start the job hunt. But here comes my mom telling me how I am lazy and not any better than I was and takes everything I do as a sign that I\u2019m spiraling or something again. I\u2019m not gonna lie, the biggest issue has been me liking to smoke weed. It\u2019s not excessive and at the end of the day after I have everything done.. but I do enjoy it quite a bit and do believe it has been helpful with my depression. it isn\u2019t a problem until she finds out I am smoking. I have been working 2 jobs, finished school, and have a plan set for my future. So obviously it hasn\u2019t been affecting me. She hadn\u2019t even noticed anything until a couple days ago when she smelled it. \n\nI get it. She\u2019s worried. But she has no idea what is going on in my head but assumes she does. Won\u2019t listen when I tell her. Wants complete control. And only has negative things to say about any choice or decision I make. Never supportive. And just makes me feel like shit when I just accomplished the one thing that was making me want to put a gun in my mouth or take a hand full of pills for the last 5 years. It should have been a happy day. But now I feel just like I did a year ago. I hate getting guilt tripped into agreeing with her because she\u2019s my mom. When I do say she is the one causing my problems now she cries and makes me feel like a crappy son. I\u2019m just over it and don\u2019t know what to do..I\u2019m 25 and have to be able to make my own decisions to learn from my mistakes if I make the wrong one. Not her making them for me or waiting to say I told you so.. \n\nLike I\u2019ve been depressed for 5 years, and have only been getting better for 6 months. Obviously I\u2019m still gonna be \u201coff\u201d and not 100% better for a while until I learn how to fully love myself and am completely happy again.

Even though he would remind me a lot that it wasn\u2019t a relationship, I naively though that he just needed some time to be \u201csingle\u201d before committing to me... he gave off that impression when he broke up with me in the first place.. \n\nThis went on for just over a year, then last week he told me he was seeing someone else now. I\u2019m heartbroken and angry and frustrated all at the same time, but mostly I just have this heavy numb all over. He told me this a day after trying to get nudes of me so he was already being unfaithful to this new girl. He wanted to stay friends and it took my whole being just to tell him no, it was so heart wrenching, he was my best friend as well as everything else. \n\nSomething that drives me nuts is that he still said I\u2019m the best person he\u2019s ever met... whilst with another girl... it just makes me think that if someone who thinks so highly of me can\u2019t love me then who can?? \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 days since I cut him out and it\u2019s been ridiculously hard, everything reminds me of him, all the things I used to enjoy make me feel anxious and sad. So many of my memories are of him and they\u2019re sour and make me feel so lost. My self esteem is so low I struggled with depression before this happened and my work life is really awful and unstable at the moment, my boss has practically threatened suicide if I leave the workplace so even when my doctor signed me off with depression I continues working to make sure she was okay.. I used to talk about my work issues with my ex because I trusted him but now I just deal with this on my own.. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I have any close friends to ask help from, I see a therapist and am on antidepressants but it\u2019s not the same as having the support from someone who isn\u2019t paid to listen to you... \n\nI\u2019m trying to keep myself busy but thoughts of him and what he\u2019s doing with another girl keep invading my mind, I\u2019m doing all I can not to go on his Facebook or message him and I\u2019ve been successful so far, but I keep getting angry and frustrated that I can\u2019t tell him how I feel..

I'm starting to isolate myself and just do nothing when generally I would want to be out doing things.  I've had plenty of social opportunities come up and I have consistently turned them down, and have wanted to be alone for really no particular reason.  I feel like I don't have the energy to keep up a conversation beyond small talk, and am becoming increasingly apathetic about many things in my life.  I also have a lack of interest about a lot of things that I would normally enjoy or want to learn about.  I'll try to get something going but will quit after a few minutes as if it's just not worth the effort.  I'll also have bouts of mild anxiety, which will make it difficult for me to sleep at times, but it's nothing severe or debilitating beyond that.  I feel as though I'm never 100% present.  My mind is wandering and it's difficult to organize my thoughts when I have to convey them verbally or even something like this post.\n\nI've tried to force myself to do things like get out and socialize but I keep flaking out at the last minute and going right back to doing nothing.  I'm still able to go to work, pay bills, keep up with working out, and eating properly.\n\nThe reason I'm starting to be a bit concerned is because I know that these are symptoms of depression.  The only thing is I'm not sad most of the time and I'm still able to keep going about my life, even if I'm just going through the motions.

I (m 22) broke off my relationship like a year ago, my ex clearly moved on but I didn't. I don't even think that's it's the fact that I didn't move on, it's just that I can't do better, I get virtually no matches on tinder even though I think I'm above average. I didn't have any friends remaining after my 3 year relationship. I'm done with college and missed out my college life to working full-time alongside college and a relationship, it's hard to even meet new people anymore. My ex was my best friend and really it's been so so so lonely without any real friends after that.\n\nI really don't know what the fuck to do anymore.\n\nThis has been a horrible couple of years for me, this year - I tried starting a business but I don't have the capital to even get the initial traction/to get the ball rolling. I haven't been able to find any girl who I like. I live with my family, which is my parents and one sister and there's never peace in the house my elder sister who is approx 30 31 really has some issues and there really hasn't been peace in the house for the last 5 10 years. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that there are screaming battles and violence's in my house almost on a daily basis, imagine growing up with that. I so want to move out, but have to decide whether I need to get braces and other fix my insecurities and not move out because I can't afford both that and rent. Or move out and live with my fucking insecurities because my parents were barely ever there for me and never solving any of my problems unless it was an emergency in their eyes. Nevertheless therapy is out of the option because I obviously can't afford it, or as my dad says, if insurance doesn't cover it, no need to think about it. And to be honest, my dad is the only semi sane one in my family, my mom and sister really have some sort of mental issues. Their just so fucking violent, nagging all the time, hate each other's guts and just never peaceful.\n\nI have no real friends, just fake friends or as I'd like to call them, acquantainces. I can't even hang out with them, due to the same reason I couldn't hang out with them before my relationship - I cannot afford to. It just seems like everyone's born with a silver spoon up their ass and my family can't even afford to provide with basic shit let alone money to go clubbing or to concerts or bars on a weekly basis. I'm really sorry for acting so salty but after dealing with this for 22 years and never really getting anything I've ever wanted, I think it's a fair reaction.\n\nI just need advice on how to restart my life, what should I prioritize - moving out and treating myself and fixing my insecurities, like my fucked up teeth, my weight etc. Oh another icing on the cake is that after being active in the gym and an active lifestyle, I've been diagnosed with permanent weakness in my wrists which means I can't do simple shit like pushups for atleast another year or two. There's never any healthy food in my house it's all oil, seems like no one gives a shit about their own health and definately not their kids.\n\nHere's how I picture myself after 3 years, I'm a successful entrepreneur, moved out with my own studio, treated all my insecurities which my family members have neglected all my life, go to therapy consistently, and repair the last 22 years worth of scars.\n\nHow do I do this? I really am tired of waiting. For the last week, I think I've lost all hope, been sitting home watching HIMYM, day dreaming about when I'll find the one for me (I'm not interested in flings, I just want reliability) and sleeping. I used to be on fire for all the months before the last one or two, working 18 hours a day on my startup, but I've just been so demotivated lately and want to fix my fucking life.\n\nSorry for the huge ass post.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T21:00:49+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T21:00:49+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eapa0j/i_really_dont_know_what_to_do/"}

My dad and my sister. Ill start with my dad. When i was in 4,5, and 7th grade, my dad forced me into boxing with my brother. 5x a week i would have to go. I hated it but had to go. Y you may ask \u201cto learn to defend yourself\u201d there are classes exactly for that. Its just that he likes boxing. Ok fine you did something you thought was good for me. I got grounded a couple times because i would even speak out against it but fine. Then my mom puts me into an lapd cadet program. I like it and try to sign up for every possible event. Ig my dad noticed i liked it so now he said you can only go once a week. Wtf i am supposed to go 2x for meetings so i cant sign up for anything. You are saying, if i hate something i HAVE to go 5x a week but if i like it i cant even go 3x a week. Or even 2x. In truth i recently realized why i like the program. Because i am not home. I hate being home. This ties on to the second problem. My sister. Anything and everything i do gets me yelled at. She screams at me rudely for everything. If its not me getting yelled at its that hum of disapproval. I hate it. I wake up and walk to the kitchen. \u201cJesus bla bla bla bla!!!!!\u201d The phycological torture i deal with of getting yelled at for everything. Not even the military is as bad they get screamed at for doing something wrong but not for everything. And most of the time they are not singled out unless they are really doing something wrong. To make matters worse, any thing i say/do to her gets me in trouble and my whole family defends her. \u201cShe is like that\u201d well she can change if you assholes do something. I am the youngest and have no word in anything. I ask my mom something \u201cNo\u201d my sister will scream instantly at anything. I am only 13 and i cannot survive another 5 years of this.

I don't live here with my mom and step dad anymore. I live in another state and am trying to do things up there after college. Anyways, I'm an only child, and my mom married this guy when I was 12. Never liked him. Went through another divorce case at 13 to go live with my dad. That is still traumatic to this day, it's just a huge scar.\n\nThis guy is such a worthless human being. His comments and tone set me on fire, I've never heard someone speak like he does. I just got surgery today on my wisdom teeth and I'm back home at their place for about 3 weeks, maybe longer. Anyways I always ignore him as much as I can, don't leave my room to even grab water sometimes, or food.\n\nI'm rambling, but tonight my mom and I were talking about my grandpa, her dad, that just passed a month ago. She was talking about this shirt that she got him for Christmas. She was joking and said he probably burned it because he joking hated it, she didn't find the shirt after cleaning out his house. Then my step dad, who ALWAYS makes fucking comments when my Mom I are talking on the couch and he's just sitting in his chair on his fucking ipad playing this stupid game 12 hours a day goes \"he should of burned the cat too while he was at it\". then my mom said \"Oh my gosh, stop, don't say that\". Then he says, \"I don't care. I'm being serious, she's terrible, he should have burned her too\". Then my mom goes stop talking that way, and i butt in after I'm high as a kite from my wisdom teeth surgery and say that's fucked up, why would you say that? He then again says \"I don't care, she's a terrible cat\". My mom and I probably told him 5 times to stop saying that, and he wouldn't stop, it fucking hurt thinking about him basically getting pleasure from our cat burning to death.\n\nHe's a sick worthless fuck. His comment history is just piled with fucked up comments, I promise you it's a fucking million more things than just this incident. He's been fucked up at 2 funerals now, and every day, almost every fucking conversation I try to have, he;s fucking butting being a fucked up smartass! It's unreal! Back to the conversation, my mom said anyways moving on, I guess my dad got rid of the shirt because I couldn't find it, oh well. Then my step dad ended the conversation again saying \"yeah well he also forgot to burn the cat\". I know what he'd say if we started to yell, he'd say y'all are so sensitive and I'm just kidding. Jeez get over it. Mother fucker then why did you say Im serious and that you don't care?? Then, when we changed the subject, why'd you go back to it? I don't deal with shit like that, especially when my mom I are still struggling with my grandpas passing which he reluctantly helped out for because he just tries to look good in front of my mom's family. Behind closed doors he's a monster. I try my fucking hardest to not hate anyone, but I can't help that out of everyone I have met in my life, I truly hate him, and cannot wait for the day he dies. The trauma from 12 to 24 will never leave me. I will never be at his fucking funeral.\n\nI'm starting to lose it now as I've grown from a kid to an adult. I've been so close to hitting him or just slapping him hard as hell, but that would just cause a lot of drama. It's like no matter what I do or day, or what my mom says, he just won't shut up. He's constantly trying to be right even when's he dead fucking wrong, it's amazing. Such a piece of shit. I wish I could type more but this is getting long. Thank you so much if you've read this. I just wanna ask y'all.. I'm lost, and I don't know what to do anymore, I tell my mom that he hurts my feelings and makes me uncomfortable all the time, especially when she's out of the house, and she always says she's gonna say something or do something, but she's a broken record on this. They'll never get divorced, I've pretty much accepted that. Some days I really, really do feel like raising hell, maybe I will. He just needs to shut the fuck up. It;s been 12 years now and he just won't change, ever. After being talked to so many times, he just goes right back to his fucked up ways. God I can't wait til the day he dies. It will be such a fucking relief. So.. what do I do? Going to the police seems extreme, but a possibility, I've told some of my family members and they just don't do anything about it because \"they're not married to him\" or it's not their problem. I've screamed at him before several times, and he usually just freezes up but then later goes back to his ways. Plus it makes the house extremely fucking awkward and my mom just doesn't do much about it. It feels so fucking hopeless. Do I raise hell? Should I raise my voice more? Should I slap him, throw something at him? Screaming into my mom for 12 years has gotten this nowhere. I'm too fucking nice sometimes. I can't fucking take it anymore, I am going to fucking snap.

I haven\u2019t been able to find one in over a year. \n\nThose closest to me have always focused on how great I am with people and how easily I can brighten someone\u2019s day, but all of that comes from me just trying to do what I\u2019d want someone to do for me, but even I don\u2019t want that, if that makes sense? \n\nThe happy face and joy I bring to others is what people admire most about me, and it\u2019s all built on my own debilitating depression. I\u2019ll talk with others about their struggles with depression and seem to genuinely help them shift gears, so to speak, but can never do that for myself.\n\nI self medicated for a long time but that\u2019s stopped, and I just don\u2019t want to do anything like that anymore. I don\u2019t want to go on pills that seem to cause more harm than good. I\u2019m so utterly depressed that a glass of liquor will sit on my counter for weeks at a time before I pour it down the drain.\n\nI browse reddit and sleep whenever I\u2019m not working. My dreams are an escape, and that\u2019s it. I cannot remember the last time I genuinely smiled. I\u2019m just tired. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I expect to get by posting this, but it seemed a good a place as any to type out my thoughts. \n\nThanks for reading, and I hope that you can avoid the way I feel. I hope your day today has a genuine smile in it, a distraction you can use to get away from this world, or someone to embrace you and love you for the true you \u2014 depressed or not.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T20:28:32+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T20:28:33+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaov27/finally_lost_the_will_to_happy_face/"}

I literally feel nothing anymore... I struggle very hard with trying to express my emotions and trying to just understand how myself I am feeling. Im always in a numb state of mind and I\u2019ve dealt with it for so long that it\u2019s just normal to me now. To just ignore my problems to push away the pain. I\u2019ve only recently come to the point in my life where I\u2019m t trying to get help but nothing is actually helping. I... I don\u2019t even know what to write, my brain just never seems to be clear, I am never able to focus. (So excuse any errors) But I\u2019ve come to a point in my life where I don\u2019t know what to do like at all. I have a very loving boyfriend who\u2019s takes very good care of me, and I feel horrible because whenever I get sad or upset, I go into a numb state and just can\u2019t seem to do anything to fix it other than ignore it and suffer until it passes. I mentally and physically refuse to accept I am in pain. The one question I hate is \u201cWhats Wrong\u201d... the question haunts me. Whenever it\u2019s asked all I ever say is I don\u2019t know. \n\nPlease excuse me if this is all over the place and unorganized. But honestly I have no proper mind functionality, I go off on tangents often and my apologies once again.  I\u2019ve lost several jobs because I can\u2019t go through the pain of going but can go to stores and so just fine which I don\u2019t get. I want to work, I want to make money, but when I do so I would cry at work and it would be horrid. Im currently unemployed and I live with my parents and don\u2019t get me wrong I love and appreciate everything they do but mentally I feel as if they could not give any f**ks to what would happen to me. I\u2019ve never received any help mentally from them, never a \u201cits gonna be okay\u201d ,  \u201cyou\u2019re safe\u201d , \u201cwere here for you\u201d. Never even s hug when they see my crying. Just why are you crying, people have it worse. \n\nIm not sure what I hope to get from posting any of this. But I just want to share my personal struggles with depression. I also deny the fact I have it, I feel as if I\u2019m lying to myself or just trying to give myself an excuse to why I\u2019m such a failure at the moment. I also dropped out of college because going became too difficult to me. I did enjoy college though :/\n\nI just ughh I wish I knew how to properly write and explain my feelings. I\u2019m just so over they place. I\u2019ve recently dealt with the thoughts of passive aggressive suicidal tendencies. I believe that\u2019s what it\u2019s called. Where I no longer want to live but don\u2019t want to die? \nThe only emotional support I receive is from my boyfriend (He does an amazing job... but lives across the sea and I still have yet to meet him) I\u2019m to scared to go to my parents. I would think my mother understands the most since she had been through it herself and harmed and tried horrid things.... but no. She give me the most shit for how I am. I was in the hospital for a attempt and she sat with me and just basically told me... \u201cyou\u2019re 20 now you really need to stop acting like this and get your shit together\u201d.

Over the past month or so, I decided to try and seriously work on my mental health &amp; I do feel I\u2019ve made some progress. I moved back home (closer to my girlfriend and family), I withdrew from last semester at the University I was attending, and I\u2019ve been on Lexapro for approx 6-7 weeks. \n\nBelow I\u2019ll list what I\u2019ve experienced with the medicine so anyone who may be prescribed it will know what to expect.\n\n***Positives***\n-\tAnxiety has been severely diminished\n-\tOverall sense of calmness (especially right after taking the medicine)\n-\tDepressive episodes have reduced greatly (used to be an everyday thing, I\u2019ve been probably 2-3 weeks without one)\n-\tI actually have motivation to do basic things (and sometimes I actually find myself doing some of the stuff I used to really enjoy).\n\n***Negatives***\n-\tLexapro can cause insomnia if taken late at night\n-\tLexapro can also cause reduced sex drive &amp; the inability to ejaculate\n-\tIf you don\u2019t take the medicine for more than 2 days, you will quickly become irritable and agitated\n\n***Tips***\n-\tTake your Lexapro as soon as you wake up, the medicine will be in your system by time you go to bed, which will help reduce the insomnia effect.\n-\tIf you are still unable to sleep, you can take melatonin to help regulate your sleep schedule (ONLY TAKE THE PRESCRIBED DOSE).\n-\tAs for the reduced sex drive &amp; inability to ejaculate, there isn\u2019t much you can do to fight these symptoms. If you masturbate heavily, reducing the frequency you do so could be incredibly beneficial. Once your genitalia become desensitized due to excessive masturbation, combined with the affects of Lexapro, you may even find it impossible to keep an erection. The best tip for this is to just completely abstain from masturbation &amp; only seek out sexual pleasure with a significant other.\n-\tYou may get an upset stomach when first getting on Lexapro; however, as time passes, your body will get used to it and you will have less problems.\n\n\nRemember, not everyone is the same. Some of you may not have any of these issues, and some of you may have more than what was listed. My advice is to find what works for you. For me, I was lucky that the Lexapro actually has been extremely helpful. For you, a different medicine may work to your advantage. While the negatives of SSRI\u2019s are something we all must deal with (if you choose to follow a medication route), and typically the side affects are worth the peace of mind that the medicine will bring.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T19:51:45+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T19:51:46+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaodmm/been_on_lexapro_for_a_month_heres_my_experience/"}

All my life, I  have been a great student, excelling everyone's expectations. Everyone around be, parents, relatives and teachers, thought I would be a doctor. When everyone in your life tells you ever since you were a child about what you should do, you start believing it and pursuing it and defining your identity around it. That is what I did. \n\nBut in my final years of college, I started have doubts, questioning everything I was doing. I didn't feel happy in any of my classes and was just doing things other pre-med students were doing, half-heartedly and purpose-lessly. I was depressed, not taking care of myself, spending days in bed with no motivation. But no one knew cuz I didn't want them to know. I am good at faking it and keeping my emotions bottled. So I did what was expected, in my final year before graduation, I applied to medical school thinking I have come this far and this is what is expected of me. I didn't get in and after that, my depression has worsened. \n\nI didn't attend my own graduation even though I had one of th highest GPAs in my class. I was ashamed, not because I didnt get into medical school when everyone else did, but because I was at a point in my life where I didn't know who I was and who I wanted to be. I am constantly surrounded by those who know where they are going and at least have a plan. For me, when all my life I have worked toward becoming one thing and now I am realizing that one thing isn't for me,I FEEL LOST, HOPELESS, like a failure, DEJECTED, not good enough and the list goes on.\n\nNow, my parents keep asking that I should apply to med again but I know in my heart that is not what I want in my life. It has been a while since I have been feeling it but only recently I came to terms with it. My parents aren't the forcing type but they want answers about what I want to do if not med. And I DON'T have those answers. I don't know anymore. I am not motivated to do anything. Even my own family doctor expected me to be a doctor lol so I have disappointed her too and I cant even talk to her about my depression because I know first thing she would ask me when I go to her is why I am not applying again and try to convince me to apply again. It sucks when you don't feel a safe space with your own doctor cuz she says what my parents say. \n\nI am only 22 but my parents think I am getting old and need to get my life together, settle down. And at this point, I don't even think life is worth living when all I have done so far is disappoint everyone around me and will continue to disappoint as I don't know where to go next. I just need a reason to live and to go one because everyday its hard to get myself up and do things. I want to live a fulfilling life, do something that makes me happy, but right now, I just need a will to live and to move forward and I don't have any of that.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, thank you for reading.

Lots of it was impostor syndrome while I was in law school, lots of it was years of negative self-talk finally coming to a breaking point. These past few years i've flirted with the idea of self-harm, though thankfully I never took it to the next step.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i've graduated, failed the bar, just submitted my application to take it again in February. The shitty thing is I'm not sure if i'm taking it because I actually want to be a lawyer, or if it's a sense of obligation. Of course if I talk to my law school peers or people from work, they tell me I need to retake it and i'll \"be fine\" and that they're \"sure I'll pass!\" But I can't help but feel like that's bullshit. I feel like for the past however long, i've been extremely mechanical. Get up, go to point A, then point B, come home, sleep. Rinse, wash, repeat. Not much feels genuine anymore, most things feel like i'm doing them out of obligation or what is expected of a \"functioning\" adult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think i've come up with the perfect analogy.

It kept me up thinking it over how some people have argued before that death is similar to life before we were born. Not withstanding the religious divergence regarding re-incarnation, heaven/hell, or whatever else may be - I disagree with the philosophy that death will be like what it was before we were born (I.e. Billions of years passed before you were born and you weren't conscious, so it will be the same when you die).\n\nI believe that 'Nothing --&gt; Something' is *not* the same as 'Something --&gt; Nothing'. Before we are born, we cannot comprehend life or death, they do not exist as we do not exist. When we are alive we have the capacity to know what life is and recognise what the absence of it is. That being, a permanent loss of awareness, consciousness, or the capacity to experience the world around us. ('Oh it will be like falling asleep and not waking up' I dislike the falling asleep forever comparison)\n\nI cannot stop it. Everyone who has ever lived has died - or is dying. If there was any means by which someone from beyond could show us there is something beyond death, billions of people who have lived and died have failed to show us how. For this reason and others, I do not think there is anything after death. As much as I want I cannot stop it from happening.

I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder shortly before beginning college. I take Lexapro to deal with my anxiety. My depression is linked to a cascade of things from the recent past. I graduated high school dating a girl I had been with since early in my junior year. \n\nBy the time I started college I found myself breaking down, as I discovered I didn\u2019t like my major and it had gotten too late to change it. I had no idea what I wanted to study or if I even wanted to be in college. At the same time, I was trapped in a relationship with someone who thought she was marrying me. I was guilted into spending 100% of my time with her. After meeting my current girlfriend at college,  I developed a crush on her and realized I needed to get out of my relationship because I was not in love. This ended up being a monthlong struggle of harassment and guilt tripping from my ex. There were multiple times where she falsely lead me to believe she was about to commit suicide. \n\nThis eventually passed, and I started taking interest in this new girl I met at my college. We went on a few dates and had our first kiss within just a few weeks of meeting. I immediately felt a spark. I had never felt so alive in my life. Then she began acting odd, ignoring all of my messages. She later told me she didn\u2019t want a relationship. We still hung out, but as friends. She sent mixed messages by flirting at times and then seeming disinterested. I realized I did not have the \npatience to play games, so I decided I was done talking to her. I ignored her messages. That same day, she called me crying and told me the truth. She was in a relationship with someone who was emotionally abusive, and she had been cheating on him with me. I am normally very against cheating, but I was relieved that it wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like me. I gave her advice on how to get out of her relationship. We then began dating. \n\nThe next few months were great. We were both very happy. We spent a lot of time together traveling and adventuring in our free time. I also had my own freedom to do the things I enjoyed. All of my close highschool friends started their own lives. Moved away for college, started new busy jobs. My best friend of 7 years lost his respect for me for how I had left my ex and moved on so quickly. He no longer talked to me and we argued anytime I tried to contact him. My new girlfriend was really all I had as a friend. I didn\u2019t make any friends at college because honestly I had forgotten how to make new friends. \n\nI began to become depressed once again because a very close family friend was struggling with cancer. His condition was worsening and I was not prepared for his death. This man was a huge part of my life, like a father. He taught me everything I know today. He passed away shortly after christmas last year. I was devastated. I spent most of my time grieving. It was difficult to find joy in anything. It was the first time I had broken down and cried in front of my girlfriend. She eventually became distant. My grieving lasted months. To make it worse, my girlfriend seemed unhappy. She no longer supported me when I had moments of depression. She just wanted to get away from me. \n\nShortly after, her father suddenly disappeared. He abandoned his daughter, son and wife because he was sick of fighting with his wife, right in the middle of selling their house. In his absence, I spent lots of time at their house. For about a month I was the man of the house, making repairs and helping wherever I could. My girlfriend\u2019s mother was very grateful. My girlfriend became depressed from all the stress of her dad leaving. She changed. Barely spoke to me. This further fueled my depression. She rejected any kind of emotional help I could offer. \n\nI became suspicious. I regret invading her privacy, but I logged into her Mac and discovered she had been lying to me from the beginning. Lied about who she had and hadn\u2019t slept with, lied about who she did and didn\u2019t keep in contact with. She was to move in with me after her parents sold their house. I found messages with an ex boyfriend discussing her relationship struggles with me. I found out she had cheated on me the day before my close friend passed away. She even lied multiple times after being confronted. \n\nI packed everything I had at her house and drove an hour home after finding all of this out. The happiest times of my life were all a lie. The emotional pain I felt while driving home and ignoring all of her calls was something I would not wish on my worst enemy. I thought of crashing my car. I thought of packing everything I owned, leaving my phone, and disappearing. I told her I was leaving her, and she was devastated. I ultimately decided to stay because I loved her and I was empathetic about her father abandoning her. I was also much too weak to go through a breakup. \n\nFrom that point on, she changed. She gave up every connection she had to her past without a doubt. Her father returned after a month and a half, and the house sold. Our relationship healed and she regained my trust. She moved in with me and her parents and brother moved to Florida. \n\nI still face random episodes of depression. I lose touch with reality and flash back to everything that happened. I still try to get closure for the things she did that I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m unable to let it all go. At times I am ashamed of myself for being blind to these things. I struggle to find confidence in my appearance and abilities. I find it difficult to be focus on self-care. It puts a strain on my relationship.

I have very little life experience at 17 and just like most people in my life have told me, I do not have any reason to be depressed. I have nothing to be sad about. My life is great; I have a house, food, water clothes, electronics, books, a car. I have everything I could want but I don't have happiness. I am playing a rigged game. \n\nI have been diagnosed with depression, or what the therapists and doctors think is depression, since 4th grade. I suffered a facial injury from being hit in the face with a baseball bat. It was an accident with no ill intent. \n\nMy friends at the time, the only ones I had and would be able to have for the next three years of elementary due to our small school, had just started to push me away. They had given up on me before I had even really been going downhill.  The school had given up on me too and they found out I had been self harming so they called my parents and forced me into therapy. My father still sticks by that, even after having self harmed from 4th grade until March of this year, I was doing it for attention because of the way the school called him.  \n\nMy friends started joking with me by calling me fat and ugly and I of course joked along because for a while it was funny. Then it wasn't but every time I spoke up they called me a baby and told me they were joking and I let them continue so they would stay around. I have always been a people pleaser. I do what I am expected to and I let people walk all over me continuously because of my hunger for love and acceptance. \n\nI grew up with an alcoholic father and a split household. My mother met my father one drunken night at a Christmas party and they started dating. They broke up sometime after I was born. I have only ever lived with them both in the same house for a year total. \n\nMy dad is a spiteful man. He was never physically harmful but he knows his way around words. He has been sober for four years and although he was hardly ever sober when I was younger, I miss when he was drunk all the time. He was usually too drunk to say mean things to me because he would pick fights at bars. Now that he is sober, he picks on me instead only because I am around twice a week and it is easy for him. He calls me worthless a lot and I blame the way he treated me as a child for my doormat tendencies. \n\nI started out being pretty level, I was sad sometimes but it was just sadness and I could handle it even if I had absolutely nobody to fall back into. As I grow up, the black empty space inside of me just grows. There were days where I could handle the void. Now the days bleed into each other. The void can be held back for a while, just long enough for school, but the minute I come home the blackhole swallows me and I end up sleeping all the time because I would rather be asleep than aware of the real world.

But if you asked him to summarize the events of that war, I don't think he could do it. More like a collection of anecdotes. No awareness that the Nazis did evil things -- or even really that there was an ideology behind the war. Consequently he'll do things like send a picture of a Nazi soldier and say \"doesn't he look like so-and-so?\"\n\n\\- Similarly obsessed with the weather, and weather reports. A big focus of his TV-watching time. \n\n\\- Strong aversion to music and noise of any kind. He doesn't even like Christmas music at Christmas. \n\n\\- Doesn't really listen at all. You can say words, sentences to him but if they're not on a topic he's already familiar with, it's like you never said those words at all. He'll just say \"uh huh, ok, I see, mm hmm\" but if you ask him afterward, it's clear he didn't hear anything. \n\n\\- Strong aversion to technology. Interestingly, he's fine with his iPad and his antenna TVs, though. But he only uses YouTube. He's afraid of other apps, and won't watch Netflix even though we got him a subscription and there's tons of, for example, World War II content. He's afraid of Apple software updates, and annoyed that Apple sends him a weekly email detailing his screen time as though it were a personal attack on him. (He has limitless time as he's retired and receives very few emails.) \n\n\\- Doesn't seem to understand what I do for a living at a basic level. He sends me technology articles on things I'd definitely know because I work in technology, and then explains them to me (mostly just regurgitating what he read) as though I wasn't aware of that topic at all. No awareness that I'm using the same apps, getting the same news feed, that I do this for work all day long. \n\n\\- Despite reading and watching videos/TV a lot, lacks extremely basic knowledge in certain areas. For example he had an iPad for 5 years and didn't know the battery icon represented battery power. He knew he couldn't let the bar go to 0%, and he knew plugging it in made it better. But he didn't know it was battery power; fundamentally he didn't know it was an electrical device. It was a revelation to him, after watching a YouTube video, that there were in fact electronics inside of his iPad. \n\n\\- Very fixed routine. For example, in the morning he watches TV in one room. In the evening, he watches TV in another room. Must be home before dark. \n\n\\- Detailed knowledge of his past which he will often recall, including very minor events attached to specific dates. \"In 1972, I believe it was May 4th, that's when your grandmother had her Uncle So-and-so over to the house.\" \n\n\\- Will attach unnecessary attributes to objects, often brand names. For example his \"Lazy Boy rocking chair\" his \"Samsung-brand TV\" when the brand isn't relevant to the conversation.

I went to uni (heavily influenced by others) first and got a 2:1 law degree. December 2017 i got prescribed anti depressants after a 5 min phone call with a doctor, i tried getting an actual appointment but couldnt. So i took those for a month but it had a bit of a placebo effect i think due to it being christmas. I didnt take it any further, but I never go better either. A few months later I saw a doctor about acid reflux and things. I think I have a condition called GERD (gastroesophageal\u00a0reflux\u00a0disease) which is like chronic acid reflux, and leaving it can lead to a pre cancerous condition called barrett's oesophagus (thats not where you put a m82 down your throat btw). I also often have digestion issues, i was tested for celiac disease and some other shit at somepoint in 2018 and the results came back fine. Maybe i have a problem eating something in particular i dunno, ive never been able to work it out besides if i drink too much coffee i get the shits lol. I also have 2 wrists that dislocate kind of. And pop back in, and it doesnt hurt really. But ive picked up a 36kg dumbbell before in an awkward way and it popped out and that hurt like hell haha. That happened from doing upright rows with a bar, so dont do it kids, it fucks your wrists, use the ropes or a dumbbell in each hand. To fix it, as far as I know from research, is having metal plates put in.\n\nI think ive been afraid to go to the doctors about these things 1. Just beacuse everyone is haha and 2. Because I'm aware having it on my medical record probably closes doors of careers I had interest in. I understand the importance of good health for a job like in the marines, its everyone elses safety as well as your own, you dont want to be fighting alongside someone whos batshit crazy (im not btw), who might have an episode and shoot you or something. My mate couldnt even get in the army because he used to have eczema 2 years ago, so i dont think there's a chance I could be in the marines if i get diagnosed with some stomach condition and get metal plates in my wrists haha.

"selftext": " \n\nthe love of my life left me\n\nwe\u2019ve only been dating for a few months, but it\u2019s crazy how such strong emotions can manifest in so little time. we met ages ago, 6 years ago in 7th grade, and despite middle/high school crushes and \u201care we even dating?\u2019s\u201d, the years passed without a thing happening and we left for college. near the end of high school, i got a boyfriend and when we were reunited summer after freshman year, i was still dating him.\n\nit never should\u2019ve happened \u2014 a music festival, too much alcohol in my system\u2026 nothing particular happened that day, but that is when it all began. a day or two later we reconnected and i went to his house to play with his cat, and it was clear that he was interested in me. i\u2019ve always thought he was cute, but he definitely glowed up even more in college. he was so sweet, we hung out a lot, and i told him that i didn\u2019t want a relationship with him, i was going back to college in a week, i already had a bf, i wasn\u2019t going to sleep with him \u2014 it was just nice connecting with an old friend, and old crush.\n\nbut i could only resist so much. he was so, so sweet, he treated me better than anyone had ever treated me, and every time i was with him, i\u2019d get the butterflies that i haven\u2019t felt in so long. at that point, i decided that this wasn\u2019t fair to my boyfriend at the time, so I ended it with him because my emotions were in complete turmoil. i fell in love, fast and hard. in between shots of rum, endless compliments, \u201ci love you\u2019s,\u201d and nonchalant future planning, I fell in love. he was everything I had ever wanted, and the only thing i wished was that we started dating earlier.\n\nthe week of bliss ended, but the happiness didn\u2019t end even after we left for college. he was still so so sweet to me, he\u2019d call me every day, compliment me every day, tell me he loved me every day. whenever we argued, he promised that though things are hard now, we would work through it together \u2014 always. that we\u2019d be together forever. so many promises broken\u2026 i was scared, i\u2019ve always been insecure, but this boy really had a way of melting away my insecurities\u2026 i was truly smitten. at one point, he even flew across the country to spend a weekend with me, and though he was tired and inevitably jet lagged, it has been one of my best weekends in college.\n\neverything began to fall apart. i still don\u2019t know why, or how it began. but it started with a drop in compliments, a drop in \u201ci love you\u2019s,\u201d a drop in call times, a drop in messages. i didn\u2019t know what was happening, i was scared, and I asked him for more. he never delivered. everything spiraled downwards from there \u2014 daily arguments, i threw away any pride and begged him for his attention, it was chaotic and it was scary. then it came, he didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. he didn\u2019t think we were working out, he didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. so many reconciliation attempts. i promised I would try my hardest, that i wanted to believe in us, that i wanted to be with him forever\u2026 i love him and even now, i can\u2019t see myself with anyone other than him\u2026 he was my future. we decided to hold off until the next break, and when we were together again, everything was right again. we decided to try again.\n\nnot even a week later, everything spiraled out of control again. i fell apart, and tried to take my own life. it was a disaster. when i was discharged from the hospital, he gave me his verdict \u2014 no more. there is no more try, he has long fallen out of love and has no desire to be with me anymore.\n\nhe doesn\u2019t want us anymore. not even a little bit.\n\nwhen the man who promised you forever, the man who you believed wholeheartedly would never leave, leaves\u2026. \n\ni don\u2019t know.\n\ni don\u2019t know how this all happened. how something so good turned into something so bad. how i can\u2019t make the one person i want to stay stay. he was my everything.\n\ni spend so much of my time thinking about him, usually it\u2019s unconsciously, and usually it\u2019s good, warm feelings of love. but then reality hits me \u2014 he\u2019s not mine anymore, he never will be. he was supposed to be mine forever.\n\ni have so much regret. if i never went to that music festival, if i never reconnected with him, none of this would\u2019ve ever happened. i was happy before we reconnected, but now, i am anything but. i am miserable, i am devastated. i\u2019m writing this amidst finals week, and i don\u2019t know how to study. i can\u2019t. i just sit there and cry. there is a permanent tightness in my chest and no matter what i do, it won\u2019t go away. whenever i try to think, only tears come.\n\nwe had so much. we had so much planned for the future. we were going to spend Christmas, together, go ice skating, kiss under mistletoes. we were going to celebrate our one year at my favorite restaurant, we were going to get married, have two children, adopt a dog. so many broken promises.\n\ni would truly give anything to have our original relationship back. it was a dream. too good to be true.\n\ni don\u2019t know what i\u2019m going to do moving forward. despite how much he\u2019s hurt me, i still want to be with him. oftentimes, i feel as if dying would be better than living a life without him.\n\nhe was the love of my life. he swept me away, and i foolishly gave him everything I had. now, he\u2019s left me with nothing. nothing but memories and regret.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T16:59:40+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T16:59:41+00:00", "subreddit": "depression",

I have my ups and downs, but it\u2019s severe this time of the year. I like to blame it on that I live far north, and the sun only stays up 3 hours a day during winter setting a downcast mood that effects all people living here I would assume. I\u2019m in my early twenties and entered university this autumn in a tough engineering program after having worked while getting my countries equivalent of the SAT scores up the years after high school. \n\nI have a lot of friends that I see often. I have traveled with both my friends and my family all over the world. I come from a wealthy family and my parents are the most supporting parents you can get. I haven\u2019t told them about my state, but I know that they have a good idea of my situation. My dad especially has tried to make an admirable effort for me to open up, but I just can\u2019t do it. This middle ground there both parties know but don\u2019t share it with each other is comfortable in an odd way but I know it\u2019s not fair towards my family. I have however opened up briefly to two of my best friends about it but I attenuated how bad I actually feel when I brought it up. The whole situation just makes me feel guilty. That I shouldn\u2019t be somebody that should be depressed. That I\u2019m just a spoiled brat that should have no business in feeling like I do and just want an excuse to feel sorry for myself.\n\nI spend most of my days sitting in front of my computer. I haven\u2019t been able to go to university for several weeks. I have learned to know some good people there, but I just can\u2019t get myself to get myself to attend the classes. I just sleep most of the day. Sleep is probably what I would consider one of the biggest problems in my life. I sleep way too much which often lead to my turning around the clock. I also experience sleep paralysis a lot, but that mostly happens after I have slept over 8-10 hours and continue sleeping.\n\nI have an immense self-hatred, yet I also show narcissistic behaviours at times, at least when it comes to my appearance. But I think that is founded in my anxiety and self-hatred as well. I want to try to see myself in a positive light in some way or another might be the cause of this. When it comes to anything to do with other people putting me in the spotlight, like my birthday or when I was able to get into university, I try to find any excuse for that not to happen. Often just by saying that I feel uncomfortable with being in such a position. My parents and my friends respect that.\n\nI think about suicide from time to time but not in a way that I would ever consider doing it. The damage that would do towards the people around me would be unforgivable. \n\nThe bottom line of this post is that I just needed to put everything it into words.

I was never suicidal but I didn\u2019t see a way I could possibly be alive any more either , I just felt nothing towards the world and felt that I was just going to be swallowed up by the earth and that was that .   I spent 2 and a half years of my teenage years manically depressed and riddled with anxiety ,  I never wanted to die I just didn\u2019t want to be alive either if that makes  sense I just felt nothing at the world and everything at the same time . There was no emotions like happiness , sadness , joyful , empathy , love , anger or any kind of human emotion but I was terrified of the world outside my house at the same time . I was removed from school and the rest of the world just disappeared . I can\u2019t really tell you much from those 2 and a half years , I\u2019m not sure if I have chosen to forget it or if my brain is purposely with holding it for trauma reasons but either way I don\u2019t think I could distinguish 5 days in that time . Birthdays , Christmas , celebrations and other important events are non existent in my memory . We battled  threw it and I was thankful enough to have a support system that  fought for me when I couldn\u2019t .  I know that\u2019s not something everyone has but I\u2019m so thankful I had it . I got put on medication after many months of my mum fighting for me to get it , I had unlimited sessions of different types of CBT once the medication allowed me to access CBT  and I made a choice  . My choice was that I knew realistically I couldn\u2019t be happy everyday but I wanted to wake up with the possibility to feel happy every day . And in time that happened life started moving again and I began to feel again . \n\nI cried today for the girl who I was and who I am , for all the people my mental Illness caused pain to , for all I missed out on and for all the problems it caused .  , I can not express how much my life today means to me not everything is perfect but there in an unlimited amount of potential for my future and that\u2019s something I could never have imagined I am happy and I am grateful   to be alive . There\u2019s a lot more to this story and it was very dark in places but what this was meant to be about is I can\u2019t promise it will get better but I really hope it does for you .

We live in diffrent cities which  makes it kinda hard for me to support her. She currently is in a  psych  ward and I plan to visit her next week and want to bring her a few  little things.\n\nI'm really unsure what to give her but I have a few things on my list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  first one is a book from Alan Watts. It's a lot about eastern  philosophy and the way we see ourself. It helped me to get a diffrent  perspective on myself and I think it may helps her aswell. She is a really smart person. There is a special chapter that I find important  that I will maybe mark for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  second one is a playlist/set I made for her. It includes a lot of slow  and sad tracks but also some more light and happy ones. I have a strong  emotional bond to all of them. I choose them because these are some of  the songs I used to listen to in times when I felt like shit, when there  was nothing I wanted to do and I was just sitting around feeling empty.  They always helped me to feel a little less bad and I hope it will do  the same for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe  third thing on my list is a little sticker that says \"Nice that you're  here\". I plan to stick it somewhere hidden when she's not looking, so she will find it a day later or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm  super unsure if these are the right things to give her. Is it to much?  Is it not enough? Are these the wrong things to bring her?\n\nThere  is also the \"problem\" that I have some fellings for her. I don't know if she still is in a relationship. I'm quite sure she  also always had some feelings for me but I don't think it's the right time to approche  this.  Maybe if she directly shows me that it is what she wants. Otherwise she needs to get better first before I do anything, I  don't want to make things weird and make her worry about our friendship.\n\nSo what do you guys think about it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if anyone is interested in the playlist/set I would be happy to share it.

She told me lots of times, that she is scared that some day she may start to behave like grandma. And I don't want to make her think so. I don't want her to worry. I feel like telling her about my depression and being open with my failures will cause her to fall into worse state again.\n\nBut I know that eventually I have to open. I don't have energy to pretend anymore. For half a year or so, I was avoiding contact with her, while before that I used to call her even every few days to talk about some trivial things.

It's a lot about eastern philosophy and the way we see ourself. It helped me to get a diffrent perspective on myself and I think it may helps her aswell. She is a really smart person. There is a special chapter that I find important that I will maybe mark for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second one is a playlist/set I made for her. It includes a lot of slow and sad tracks but aslo some more light and happy ones. I have a strong emotional bond to all of them. I choose them because these are some of the songs I used to listen to in times when I felt like shit, when there was nothing I wanted to do and I was just sitting around feeling empty. They always helped me to feel a little less bad and I hope it will do the same for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third thing on my list is a little sticker that says \"Nice that you're here\". I plan to stick it somewhere hidden when she's not looking, so that she will find it a day later or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm super unsure if these are the right things to give her. Is it to much? Is it not enough? Are these the wrong things to bring her? \n\nThere is also the \"problem\" that I have some fellings for her. I'm not sure if she still is in a relationship. I'm quite sure she  also always had some feelings for me but I don't think it's the right time to approche this right now.  Maybe if she directly shows me that it is what she wants.

I (37m) met this wonderful girl (44f) via an online dating app in September of this year and we got along and connected immediately. Things seemed almost too good to be true and it felt like we both really understood one another, had all the same aspirations for our life and within a month of being together we were telling each we loved one another. The following month we were talking about marriage at some point down the line and how crazy it seemed that everything was going as well as it was. The only thing not going great was sex, we were having lots of sex which was good but as she was on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for depression she was having trouble consistently reaching orgasm. We had planned a trip to New Orleans and unknown to me she talked to her doctor and decided to wean herself off Zoloft and increase her Wellbutrin dosage. She told me about this decision and I supported her choice however with some trepidation as she had told me the last time she went off zoloft she became depressed and that's actually how her last relationship ended and she thinks was how her marriage from a couple years ago ended as well that she became depressed. Thinking because of how good the relationship was, how happy she was and I was, I think we were both naive to think she wouldn't experience those symptoms again. She had said multiple times up to that point that this relationship was the best she's ever had, that she has never felt loved or loved anyone like this before, how she felt her father who passed as a child had sent me for her, etc. etc. I was eating this all up of course and saying similar things back because it really did feel like I had found a person I could spend my life with. I'm a hopeless romantic afterall...\n\nWithin a week of going off the zoloft, which was about 6 weeks ago, she started to get in a funk as she called it. She became \"flat\" with her emotions and didn't feel happy/sad or anything. We went on out trip and enjoyed ourselves for the most part but she definitely wasn't the same. We continued spending time together and she continued to communicate her feelings and that although she was feeling somewhat depressed that she wanted to get through the complete weening off process. The sex was better for her and she was reaching orgasms more consistently and would say how great it was and that it felt good but over the last week or so she has entered a complete depressive state. She is isolating herself from everyone, including me. We still talk most days but it's nothing like it was even a week ago. We use to talk or text throughout the day up until this week and the last couple days it's been a good morning text, maybe a couple texts during the day and a good night text. She has cancelled all the plans we've made this week and although we had planned for a nice dinner out tomorrow night for a few weeks now at her favorite restaurant that is now being cancelled too as she said yesterday that the being around any people, including me, is causing her bad anxiety. We have another trip planned the first week of January as well and anytime I've tried talk about that now, the subject is changed or she'll ignore texts about it. I want to believe this is all the depression but now that I'm nearly completely shut out I am really struggling as she is no longer communicating what she is feeling or what she is going through. My feelings have changed towards the relationship lately which I feel guilt for, I question if that initial rush I had with her was a rebound for both of us as I'm recently out of a marriage from May and her last relationship ended in April and overall I'm just struggling with what to do.\n\nTL/DR\n\nHow do I support my girlfriend when she is shutting me out and pushing me away?", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T14:57:41+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T14:57:42+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaknla/how_to_support_a_girlfriend_with_depression_and/"}

Over the last year, I've started medicating to a reasonable level of success but I still have my bad days. Last night, during a coke, ketamine and weed binge (all taken while recovering from a hangover) I finally hit the bottom. I've been depressed for so long but for the first time my eyes were open and I realised that I was the one causing all of my problems. My life is only in the state it's in because of choices I've made that got me here\n\nI was so excited to have this new perspective that I wrote myself a sort of reverse suicide note. Saying that instead of wanting to end my life, I finally realised that I wanted to live it. I realised that I need to start making positive choices in my life. I need to start choosing short term discomfort for long term gain and not the opposite. More exercise, eating better, reconnecting with people, stop being such a bummer around people and spreading your negativity\n\nSo I'm sharing it with Reddit. Why? I honestly have no idea. Maybe this will help someone else, I don't know. It's also to partly shame myself into sorting my life out. While this is a positive step, I suppose sharing it is my way of trying to make myself more accountable.

I just joined this sub and wanted to reach out. Partly because I know you share some of my feeling inherently, and partly because we don\u2019t know each other personally. I don\u2019t expect anyone to read this entire post and I have no idea how long it will end up being.\nJust a little back story, as I said I am 28, I will be 29 in March. I have been in a relationship with my wife for 8 years, married for 5, and have a son that just turned 3 this month.\n\nBack in January of this year I got a public intoxication ticket while outside of my apartment smoking a cigarette. My wife does not like drinking, smoking, drug use, or even swearing. She knows I smoke cigarettes and used to be okay with my drinking until it became a bit excessive. I believe I was using alcohol to escape the reality of not being happy. In the beginning of my 9 month probation it appeared that my marriage was ending. My wife had given up trying and I had put her through too much for too long.\n\nGo forward about a month and we are still together, and I believe that she and I are working on improving our relationship. She had communicated some of the reasons she was unhappy and I was trying to give her more time to herself and doing my best to be positive and supportive of her feelings and views.\n\nForward a bit more and I started taking antidepressants that I was prescribed from my doctor. I start to feel a bit better and life is somewhat easy to get through. At this point I am working two jobs to pay for my probation, counseling, and court costs as my wife said that I could not use our joint account to pay for any of these things. Things between us seem to continue to improve at this point.\n\nI\u2019m a bit embarrassed to admit to you that because my wife had fallen out of love with me, we had had no sexual contact or any type of intimacy for at least a year. I accepted this as I felt we had to work back to it and didn\u2019t expect her to want to do anything with someone she doesn\u2019t love.\n\nNow it\u2019s December. My son just turned three. I was off probation with no issues the day before Thanksgiving and thought that now things could start to be easier for us. At my sons birthday one of my wife\u2019s male friends whom she sees at karaoke every week shows up at my apartment. I didn\u2019t know he was coming and was a bit thrown off by this. My wife knew that I thought something was going on between them earlier in the year so I thought it was a little inconsiderate to not even tell me he was coming.\n\nNow it\u2019s Monday of this past week. I tell her I was uncomfortable with what happened and am basically told well it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Wednesday comes and as we are eating dinner my wife looks upset so I ask her what\u2019s wrong. She initially says that talking doesn\u2019t help and it doesn\u2019t matter. I pry a little more and ask her to please tell me what\u2019s wrong. She snaps at me and says that she\u2019s still not happy, nothing has changed, I haven\u2019t changed, that I\u2019m rude and inconsiderate.\n\nI felt for the past five months at least that things were getting better and had no reason to think that she was still unhappy and then I\u2019m told this. She always does this where things seem to be getting better for a long time and then she tells me one day that nothing has changed. I told her that I think she needs to talk to somebody and she is possibly depressed too to which she replies that it obviously hasn\u2019t helped me at all.\n\nThe next day I notice on Facebook that her and this particular male friend are no longer friends. I question my wife about it and she said that he unfriended her because she told him that I was uncomfortable with them being friends. So obviously between all of this, she talked to him personally which tells me that she talks to him when she\u2019s upset but not me. Am I crazy for thinking this? I had asked to see her phone just to put my mind at ease which I didn\u2019t want to do and felt wrong even asking but it would be the only way to help me with that thought pattern. She says she won\u2019t show me her phone and that I\u2019m crazy and she doesn\u2019t know why I thought she would fall back in love with me right away.\n\nSo now basically it seems like there is a divorce coming or at least a separation which means I don\u2019t get so see my son or my wife whom I love very much. My world is falling apart and it\u2019s because I thought things were getting better and I guess they weren\u2019t. Now my wife is going to leave me and be with this friend of hers.\n\nI wrote a suicide note the other day and seriously contemplated it. I\u2019ve called the hotline a few times but it doesn\u2019t seem to help much. I don\u2019t know what to do and I need more help than I thought I guess. I\u2019m afraid to die but so badly want to. I don\u2019t want to leave my son but don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even a good person to have him learn from. If he learns to act like me he will not be very well off. I feel my days are numbered and just want my wife to hug me and tell me we will get through it together like she did on our wedding day.\n\nThank you for reading my very long story. It has been therapeutic in a way to write this down. If you have any advice that may be helpful feel free to share but please be nice.

Sometimes writing it all out just helps. \n\n...\n\nIt's hard to describe what it's like in here.\n\nMy world is shattering into pieces. Usually when people use that expression it's as a metaphor, to say their life is not going so well, and things are unpleasant. But when I say my world is shattering... I mean I really can feel each shard. I look up into the sky and it shifts and moves, flickers in and out of existence as it gets cut between flashes of faces, flashes of memories that were never real, violence I've never experienced yet seems all so vivid. I continue walking down the street on autopilot, as I feel the weight of that sky fall down on my shoulders like I'm suddenly stuck at the bottom of the ocean, under the pressure of the whole world itself. I desperately try to regain control, remind myself who I am and what matters, but that just makes it worse. I arrive at my destination, and the chaos moves into my shadow. Right behind me, waiting for me to lose my focus and come back to its world. \n\nAnd then sometimes, things are okay. I can see things as they are, I know that simple every day actions won't have drastic world ending consequences, and I can function. But this world is flat. I still smile, laugh, react in the ways I should, but it feels wrong. Behind all of that, the puppet-master pulling the strings, there is a broken figure. They have wild eyes, a wide smile, and a confidence which says they know full well that they are in control. And I am not. The world is okay, I can feel as I should, but waiting for me underneath it all is this evil, shadowy emptiness, just waiting for me to slip up. To spend one moment looking inward, one moment without focus, to remind me that all of this is for nothing. That in the end, I know where my deathbed lays. I know this won't last.\n\nI constantly debate whether this chaos is a natural part of being human, or if the ever growing pile of issues and pain was purely bad luck, a terrible combination of unfortunate genetics and circumstance culminating in a life doomed to fail. On the one hand, if this is normal, that means I can beat it. Suck it up, and grow stronger. That would also support my theory that we're all actually in hell, being tortured with just enough issues to keep us struggling but never enough to truly, truly end things. The main point for this theory is that it would mean I can beat this. It makes the monster vulnerable because others have done this too, gives proof to the idea that this can end. On the other hand, if this truly is just bad luck. No control, nothing that could have been done to prevent it. I was born with a twin no one could see, a companion growing inside me learning to tear me apart piece by piece like a tumour, slowly sucking out my life. That would mean I already know how this ends. Regardless of which theory is correct, there is no magic pill. There is no drug, no therapy, no words of wisdom that will take this away. The best I can ever hope for is to learn how to balance the weight of this world, make exactly the right movements and say exactly the right things to keep it from all toppling down again. If there really is no choice to this, and I really am just a lit stick of dynamite with a wick no one can see to say how long or short it may be, the result will always be an explosion. Whether that be now or in twenty years, entropy will always take it's course. What goes up must come down, this weight will topple, that wick will burn and this all will end. \n\nBut even amongst all of this. I like petting animals. I like the smiles on children's faces. I like cold days, snuggled up in blankets. I like the shape of my partner's hand in mine. I like chocolate. I like the beach after the sun has gone down, when no one is left to crowd it. I like seeing the stars, the sky, the shapes and colours of the world. The smell of coffee in the morning. The colour blue. I like the softness of stuffed animals. The comfort of a bed after a day of hard work. The feel of paint and pen being put on paper by my hand, my tiny, insignificant marks on the world. \n\nThese things make us human. And regardless of the chaos in my mind, these things will remain. The sky itself may fall, the demons in my head may never leave. Maybe I die old, or maybe I die at their hands. Whichever way I go, however my future looks, I will have lived. There will be people who remember me, even if only as a face they saw once, or that person who never really spoke, and sort of just stared at nothing all the time. I was here. I have to remember that as far into myself as I may fall, I exist. I am real. \n\nI will scream at this brick wall until my lungs have no more air. I will shout into the void, even if the real world never hears a sound. I will cover myself in permanent marks of passion, of artwork, of life itself to build myself into something greater, because in the end it will all be gone.\n\nThe fire burns, my skin falls away. \nThe fight is meaningless. No one wins.\n\nI will not fall to the ashes silently. \n\nEven if not a living soul hears me, this world will know my name.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T13:21:17+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T13:21:18+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eajn2f/the_struggle_of_human_existence/"}

I\u2019ve been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember but I was never really sure if I could actually call it that or just feeling sorry for myself. Is it actual depression or just pity. I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019m too aware and I see things as they truly are and it causes me to have an existential crisis. It\u2019s a curse really. \n\nI could never really relate to anyone in my immediate or extended family which angers me and makes me feel lonely. But not only do I get angry at my family at times I also get angry at myself BECAUSE I get angry at them. I appear moody and lash out which makes me feel like total crap. My parents, if I\u2019m being brutally honest, are partly to blame and my mom knows that but it makes me feel SO guilty. I try to hide it as much as I can though I feel like it exacerbates my depression. My dad on the other hand has always been a pretty cheerful guy. I would say he pretty much lives by \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d. It pains me because I feel horrible for him to have me a son. We have some things in common like the same taste in music and movies for the most part but not much other than that. Perhaps the reason why I watch a lot of movies with him is my attempt to connect with him. I\u2019m sure he has an idea of my depression but I\u2019ve never really talked with him about it and it makes me feel horrible because he doesn\u2019t really understand the full extent of depression and has a much simpler outlook in life by saying \u201cyou can\u2019t take life too seriously. You just gotta take it easy and be happy.\u201d If only it were that simple. But I don\u2019t see myself working up the courage to eventually tell him what a cowardly son he has anytime soon. \n\nI began seeing a psychiatrist this summer but recently I started feeling like they don\u2019t actually care.  Some are just looking for a paycheck. I will admit however it helped a bit with my uncertainty. In a strange way, knowing and being diagnosed with clinical depression was a reassurance. Finding this sub helped a lot too. I read some of the posts on here and I, too, think \u201cI\u2019m too aware\u201d, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I simply be happy?\u201d, and \u201cIs my life depressing or do I just want it to be?\u201d etc. etc. Without my psychiatrist and this sub, I would\u2019ve lived in uncomfortable uncertainty. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more I could say but I don\u2019t want to ramble on and type too much. I think I\u2019ve accepted and am ready to live the rest of my life the way it is now. Introverted, lonely, being a loser/coward, depressed.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m writing this is to thank all of you :) and try to get some of this off my chest.

I wrote a dumb little note just willing my belongings to my family. And I walked down to a creek. My Hope's were to slice my throat and hit a artery then drift away. As I sat there along the bed of water. I contemplated everything. All of my life that I had lived up until that point. The places I've been the people I've met. I thought about how in my rough childhood I didn't think I'd ever survive until adult hood. I thought about all the girls I'd been with.  The significant relationships and bonds I've made. Ones that other people have a very hard time making. That just come easily to me. I thought and asked myself were the issues in my life at that point so irreversible that killing myself would be a better option? I reminded myself just how many times I've beaten the odds before. How many times I'd survived suicide attempts before. Surely they must mean something? Surely there was a reason I didn't die. Some distant thing I was meant to do in the unforeseen future. So mentally I cataloged all the things I didn't like in my life at that moment. And I told myself I'd give myself a year to change them all. And if by then I'd still felt the same way, still felt like an heroing. Then, then I'd do it. \n\nAnd I did. I had changed so much in my life. I got off social security. Knowing that lazying about all day collecting government checks was only hurting my ego. Because for me there's no sense of accomplishment in that. There's also no hope in ever bettering my life to one of luxury. Because the amount of money they give is hardly sustainable. I told myself I'd lose weight. And I did. I started working out and eating better. I haven't lost nearly as much as I'd wanted. But I have lost some. And it's a start. I told myself Id quit trying to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle. I was drinking so much back then. Days just melted away into one big depressed blur. And towards the end there I hated it. I hated drinking and being drunk and god, the hang overs. I don't miss them either.  I wasn't even doing anything fun with the drunk. No parties or celebrations. Just liquor, being alone and crying  or puking myself to sleep. So I quit that. I also quit smoking. For the same reason I quit drinking. I despised that I was doing it. It didn't even make me feel better anymore. I still had the same empty feeling I did after. So what's the point? Ya know?  \n\nSo now I'm a healthier me, I have a real job. I'm looking into going to school and my life has significantly changed. But I still feel the same emptiness I did before. And now I feel sort of silly for thinking such changes could have made that different. This realization has put me into a downward spiral. So I said 'fuck it\".  And got drunk the other day, and I started smoking again. But as I had already realized it didn't help. It didn't help that I feel so disconnected from everyone. Like I have friends, and people that care for me. But I just feel so numb to it all. I can't talk to half of the people in my life  like this cause they dont know wtf to say or just ignore it. And the other half I have to be strong for and I can't be weak for the people I'm trying to be strong for. But god, I'm falling to pieces.  These days I can't even find the will to leave my bed. Normally things like work would help me forget just how sad I am. But I can't seem to shake it. And now I can't even look back and cheer myself up with my accomplishments cause I relapsed. Granted I don't want to start my old habits up again. But it doesn't matter anyways because it feels like no matter what I do. Good or bad there's this empty abyss inside of me, that I have to consistently battle. Idk. I'll definitely delete this later. My life is at a point where I am dealing with a lot so perhaps that's why this internal struggle is so hard at the moment.

This is a job that will let me move to the country I want, my boyfriend's country, and I hate my living situation right now (I live with a parent) and I really want and need to move. But this job is also a job that requires me to always rely on my co-workers to ride a taxi together because the country isn't that safe etc, so I would always have to talk with them and they also party a lot after work apparently.\n\nAs my anxiety got better from therapy, while exposing myself to situations that challenges my anxiety I've realized that I'm just pretending to be someone in not. Sometimes I don't want to talk with people just because I don't want, not always because I'm anxious, but because I have an introverted personality.\n\nIt's like society demands me to act extroverted if I want to go somewhere in life. Always have to be social at work, in meetings, with my family, with my bfs family(those times I visited him it demanded a lot from me as they are always socializing and they are also noisy people). \n\nBeing around noisy extroverted people exhaust me even when I'm not anxious. Even though I want this job, I want friends, I want to move, I just can't seem to keep up with what life demands from me to do all of that, and then depression seems to hit me worse.\n\nMy plan is now to consult my doctor about  antidepressants to manage to keep up and have the life I want.

Insecure of ANY female around my age I spoke to, sometimes not speaking to me for a few days after I'd she just saw me talk to someone.\n\nSo yea, I get the relationship was actually toxic, and bad, and I'm glad it's over. Heck, the person she is seeing now, I think she was seeing and sleeping with well over a year ago. Go figure.\n\nNow, the problem is the housing market. I'm stuck, living with her still, and not just her, but her 2 kids.\n\nI'm trapped, living with essentially another family, who dont want me there. The atmosphere changes between amicable, to horrific and tense. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I feel small, sometimes im worse than a piece of shit someone stepped in, in what is my own home, the place I should have peace. \n\nI just feel burnt out and drained.\n\nI dont know what I'm coming back to, things were fine again all last week, everyone laughing and chatting away, then 3 days ago, apparently I broke something of exs (while I wasnt even in, was at work, and in a room I never go in, but....it MUST have been me, as the girls said it wasnt them). So now I have silence and huffing whenever I walk around or past her, and the girls just ignore me to not annoy their mum. Its like I dont exist, and I feel so empty and small, and just like crying all the time. \n\nWork is hell, but sometimes I feel that's better than being at home.\n\nI can go and see friends and family occasionally, but that isnt the peace I want, I want somewhere I can go to to escape, by myself, with no atmosphere sometimes, and I feel I have that nowhere. It's like suffocating and not being able to breath, and I dont know how much more i can take.\n\nI've started trying to see people, and in fact have met up with people off tinder, or even off reddit. Its and escape, however as a guy, my tablets had....side effects I wasnt bothered as much about when I wasnt seeing anyone and my ex split from me. So I went cold turkey about 2 months ago, as I couldnt put up with the side effect as I didnt want to lose that escape by having hook ups. I'm coping ok without the tablets, but it's hard at times. The tablets didnt help with my issues and circumstance though, and to be honest off them, I'm not sure they helped that much other than make me feel numb but still down. Its...hard to describe?\n\nI even had one person start to get really attached, and I'll admit, I started falling for her. But the complications at home a relationship for me hard. I cant bring anyone home, to her and her kids (shes lucky, her new fella is local, and has his own place) as that's not fair on the person I bring back, who would want to come into this house! Then out of the blue, she cut me off and told me she wanted more, I couldnt offer her more and i think that actually hurt more than my ex. I actually had a lot in common with the person, and we actually did stuff we both enjoyed, and got on really well. I wish I'd treated her better, and said how I felt sooner, but maybe it wasnt a good time or right either. \n\nI also struggle with money, as I've always paid more on the house, and we split other bits, shopping, activities out etc. Now I'm paying most stuff still, but have to buy everything else myself, sometimes just fuel to get about is my monthly money gone after bills. I'm basically paying for all the major cost of how much electric, water and heating 3 women use (2 teenage girls, it's a LOT). \n\nI'm forcing myself to get healthier, eating better, exercising and I feel better in that sense, but nothing seems to be helping head. I dont know how I can get through this block of time, and I see no light at the end. I imagined the house would be sold by now, but houses round me just arent selling well and loads are for sale already. \n\nI dont know what the point in posting is, like I say, I think I just needed to ramble and get stuff off my chest. I'll probably remove this at some point, I'm not sure.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T10:41:57+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T10:41:57+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eaibbg/trapped_monotonous_hell_stuck_living_with_ex/"}

I know some (very small percentage) of you are thinking how do you have depression/ptsd from the navy. You were on a boat for crying out loud. Crying out loud indeed, but within. Being separated from the outside world with a significant other free loading from couch to couch not knowing and general quarters (battle stations) can make a man find some kind of Jesus within himself. We called GQ and as a firefighter (secondary Job) we prepare for the worst and I mean the worst. When you realize that a carrier and how big it is can only go so fast in certain parts of the world you become aware that you are a sitting duck and have a fat and I mean (Phat) price tag on your head. you start to worry that you might drown, get blown to shit, suffocate, etc, etc. Idk why I always have to explain myself when you can get PTSD from a bad friendship let alone partnership. Anyways, I get my dear john letter and it gave me the biggest blow I could ever imagine. This was the woman I wanted to marry and someone I still have incredible feeling for. I get off deployment and come back home to find sent text messages to my phone by men that have done the deed with my partner. Off the plane I walk looking for her car at the airport I read, look at photos, and watch videos of her with other men. It was the biggest upset of my life. Here I am home finally from maybe knocking on deaths door to find the woman I absolutely cherished a woman I stayed clean for and the woman I promised would be the only one to lay with me has turned her back on me and there is proof. Since being in the navy I say the only real skill I truly pulled away from the grip of uncle Sam was how to drink professionally. I can drink a grown man that's 20 years older than me been drinking for decades longer than me look like its a normal Monday and go to work the next day. I'm 6 foot tall 200 pound man and I can damn near drink my weight in whatever liquor you throw or pour my way. I've drank two marines under the table and won blooding knuckles (the coin game) against both of them. I like to party and I need to be the center of attention but when that falls short I lash out. Sometimes I lash out before that, getting a sudden urge of anger that I can't help but find myself standing before 1, 2, sometimes 3 people and I wake up in the morning with a busted lip, fucked up hand, bruises I cant account for. Reading my text the next morning never helped and realizing I have great friends that continue to help me get home even tho I've ruined their night makes me smile inside. The truth is, yes I have a drinking problem I don't like to admit it but its there hovering in the background like your brother when you play a video game. It truly brings on those deep dark thoughts that you thought you'd never have. I didn't think I would but I should do now. I sit up at night thinking about all the wrong that I've done and the people that I have hurt and it never cures it. It only makes the problem that much worse because now I dream about it. Its an around the clock problem of how I have somehow fucked up my once perfectly good life. At one point I had it all, beautiful girlfriend, beautiful home, great job, awesome friends, and family I'd never turn my back on. Unfortunately at some point of my bullshit stampeding they had forgotten about me because I was a lost cause. My mother stopped answering my drunk calls at 6 am my father stopped putting up with my bullshit my brother looked down at me at every corner of our life my twin sister wouldn't allow me to see my nieces and nephews. I was falling harder into an alcohol induced and even when I was sober induced depression that I couldn't fight, talk, or drink my way out of. If you're still reading this I thank you from the bottom of my heart because I'm fighting everyday to not end it here this early. I have dreams of becomes a great father but in the state of mind that I'm in now I wouldn't put anyone in front of me to hear my bullshit. I refuse to take prescription drugs because it has led 3 of my close friends to checking out early. I just hope that whoever is reading this can take a step back and think about themselves for a moment. I get by life knowing that it wont be this way forever. Nothing is forever, we are given this great opportunity to feel and to be loved and to most importantly give love. You're not alone, I'm here with you and if you ever need anyone to talk you through a hard time at any point in your life please send me a message I beg of you. I've been helped by many and I will always lend out a helping hand to those in need veterans or non veterans. Depression is no fucking joke and I'm ready to let my shit out and help as many people as I possible can. I love you all for reading my rant that I wrote at 4 A.M I'm currently having an episode and writing it down helps me so maybe you should give it a try brother/sister.

But there was a time in my early 20s when I had very close friendships, the kind in which we could cuddle platonically and it wasn't weird, tell each other all our secrets, and be our weird uninhibited selves. Now I don't have friends like that. I have a few decently good friends, but there's some barrier between me and them that I feel. \n\nI don't usually feel like I can fully be myself, because now I feel like I need to measure up and be some ideal version of me that I'm not. It's only in moments of crisis that I can let go of that. \n\nI just ended a relationship where there was a lot of intimacy, but it wasn't the kind I wanted. There were too many   \nexpectations, and I was being heavily idealized. In those friendships I used to have, neither of us thought the other was perfect--we knew each other's flaws--but we still loved each other. That's what I want.\n\nThere were some tough times in those friendships, some conflict, and maybe that's why we fell out of touch. I think I actually made the mistake of not idealizing those friendships enough, of taking them for granted, and becoming resentful over time...I also didn't develop myself enough outside of them, and they became all-important to me, which I think wasn't very healthy.\n\nI want to be a better and more independent person now, but I also do want to experience that closeness and freedom to be myself again. I don't know how to find that combination. If anyone does, please let me know their thoughts on the matter. In the meantime, I'll just try harder to be a good friend to those around me, in whatever limited capacity I have right now.

I don't live here with my mom and step dad anymore. I live in another state and am trying to do things up there after college. Anyways, I'm an only child, and my mom married this guy when I was 12. Never liked him. Went through another divorce case at 13 to go live with my dad. That is still traumatic to this day, it's just a huge scar. \n\nThis guy is such a worthless human being. His comments and tone set me on fire, I've never heard someone speak like he does. I just got surgery today on my wisdom teeth and I'm back home at their place for about 3 weeks, maybe longer. Anyways I always ignore him as much as I can, don't leave my room to even grab water sometimes, or food. \n\nI'm rambling, but tonight my mom and I were talking about my grandpa, her dad, that just passed a month ago. She was talking about this shirt that she got him for Christmas. She was joking and said he probably burned it because he joking hated it, she didn't find the shirt after cleaning out his house. Then my step dad, who ALWAYS makes fucking comments when my Mom I are talking on the couch and he's just sitting in his chair on his fucking ipad playing this stupid game 12 hours a day goes \"he should of burned the cat too while he was at it\". then my mom said \"Oh my gosh, stop, don't say that\". Then he says, \"I don't care. I'm being serious, she's terrible, he should have burned her too\". Then my mom goes stop talking that way, and i butt in after I'm high as a kite from my wisdom teeth surgery and say that's fucked up, why would you say that? He then again says \"I don't care, she's a terrible cat\". My mom and I probably told him 5 times to stop saying that, and he wouldn't stop, it fucking hurt thinking about him basically getting pleasure from our cat burning to death. \n\nHe's a sick worthless fuck. His comment history is just piled with fucked up comments, I promise you it's a fucking million more things than just this incident. He's been fucked up at 2 funerals now, and every day, almost every fucking conversation I try to have, he;s fucking butting being a fucked up smartass! It's unreal! Back to the conversation, my mom said anyways moving on, I guess my dad got rid of the shirt because I couldn't find it, oh well. Then my step dad ended the conversation again saying \"yeah well he also forgot to burn the cat\". I know what he'd say if we started to yell, he'd say y'all are so sensitive and I'm just kidding. Jeez get over it. Mother fucker then why did you say Im serious and that you don't care?? Then, when we changed the subject, why'd you go back to it? I don't deal with shit like that, especially when my mom I are still struggling with my grandpas passing which he reluctantly helped out for because he just tries to look good in front of my mom's family. Behind closed doors he's a monster. I try my fucking hardest to not hate anyone, but I can't help that out of everyone I have met in my life, I truly hate him, and cannot wait for the day he dies. The trauma from 12 to 24 will never leave me. I will never be at his fucking funeral. \n\nI'm starting to lose it now as I've grown from a kid to an adult. I've been so close to hitting him or just slapping him hard as hell, but that would just cause a lot of drama. It's like no matter what I do or day, or what my mom says, he just won't shut up. He's constantly trying to be right even when's he dead fucking wrong, it's amazing. Such a piece of shit. I wish I could type more but this is getting long. Thank you so much if you've read this. I just wanna ask y'all.. I'm lost, and I don't know what to do anymore, I tell my mom that he hurts my feelings and makes me uncomfortable all the time, especially when she's out of the house, and she always says she's gonna say something or do something, but she's a broken record on this. They'll never get divorced, I've pretty much accepted that. Some days I really, really do feel like raising hell, maybe I will. He just needs to shut the fuck up. It;s been 12 years now and he just won't change, ever. After being talked to so many times, he just goes right back to his fucked up ways. God I can't wait til the day he dies. It will be such a fucking relief. So.. what do I do? Going to the police seems extreme, but a possibility, I've told some of my family members and they just don't do anything about it because \"they're not married to him\" or it's not their problem. It feels so fucking hopeless. Do I raise hell? Should I raise my voice more? Should I slap him, throw something at him? Screaming into my mom for 12 years has gotten this nowhere. I'm too fucking nice sometimes. I can't fucking take it anymore, I am going to fucking snap.

I spent my whole life taking the back seat to the more important things going on in everyone's life while trying everything in my power to be the most important thing to them and I've never been successful. At the end of the day I'm not interesting to talk to. I have a lot to say but lack the words to get it out and worry too much about social mores to start a conversation about the things that are on my mind and am too concerned about the social institutions set up to restrain people who think like I do. From time to time, I let bits and pieces of it out to those closest to me but they always end up taking it as a personal attack in which case I end up defending how I feel until I fall back on a \"logical\" thought when I concede defeat. The thoughts never go away though and I'm left feeling like an imposter. A marionette walking through life being controlled by those around me and being what they want me to be. The fear of being alone is the strings which move me because being close to those who invalidate your emotions is better than being close to no one at all. Sometimes these moments come during good times too though. I get told that I have a good heart from time to time. Most recently at a party, I noticed a guy go outside and just stand for a while. He wasn't smoking. Just standing around. So I went and checked on him. He was fine, I assume. We talked for a little and he came back in and everything was fine. It makes me wonder though. Who is coming to check on me? Sometimes old problems just make their way back around. My girlfriend is friends with the girl she cheated on me with which is ultimately what she wanted all along. She spent months on and off trying to coax me into accepting it. She swears it's different now but why should it even matter? I've given everything I have to her and the only thing that will truly make her happy is someone else in her life. Even now as I write this she's messaging her while I sit on unread being overlooked for things more interesting. I ended up making her feel bad about it and looking through their messages she's concerned about crossing boundaries as a girlfriend yet still asked her to come over after skating. I will say nothing and continue living my fake life where I pretend my girlfriend can love me and only me, where I pretend not to know all the ways she's lying to me about what they talk about, where I pretend not to know that she's taking adderall again, where I pretend not to notice that she tries to help everyone through their problems while telling me that I need to talk to someone else, where I let this lie permeate through my whole being until it gets worse and worse.

They were my last real friend and now I have no one. Not family, no friends, just strangers. I\u2019ve spent the past 2 hours just crying my eyes out and I\u2019m exhausted. I want to hug someone and just cry. \n\nI tried to eat but I don\u2019t have the motivation. I\u2019m starving and dehydrated but I don\u2019t want to eat or drink. I just want to die. With her leaving, this now marks a 100% turnover rate for every friend, I have ever made. All of them have left me for various reasons, some legitimate, some selfish. I have no one left. I feel like if I killed myself no one would even notice. No one cares about me anymore and honestly I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m still able to be saved regardless. I\u2019m tired of trying. I\u2019m tired of making friends to lose them. The longest friend I ever had was only 6 years. I\u2019ll be 21 in a few days. I feel like I\u2019m a ghost, no one notices me and no one cares about me. I\u2019m screaming for help and no one hears me. I\u2019ve screamed for so long and for so loud that my lungs have given out and I\u2019m tried of screaming. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I just want this hell to be over. I want to just fade out of existence as quickly as I came and never feel anything again. I don\u2019t want to be conscious any more. I don\u2019t want to exist. I don\u2019t want to feel anything. Good, bad, or emptiness. I simple want to stop existing, I\u2019ve already stopped living.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T08:58:08+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T08:58:09+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eahiok/i_have_no_one_left/"}

I've been depressed for years, I dont remember the last time I was really happy. For the past few years, I've been concentrating on venting through art since it wastes a lot of time and I just want time to pass quicker. Honestly, it was my only escape. For a few years I drew and sketched stuff, but i got enough negative responses that I kind of gave up. I started writing around the same time, but I realized that I got too invested in the characters and started thinking of them as my friends. This was obviously not mentally healthy, so I took a break from writing stories. I started writing lyrics (glorified poems) and music three years ago, and started recording and releasing it last year. I was actually not feeling bad when I made music, it gave me a sense of accomplishment, and I was actually improving at something for once. And then it all came crashing down. On Monday, I made a song using riffs that my guitarist sent, and I absolutely loved it. I sent it to almost everybody I knew, asking them their opinion, if the mastering was ok, if some parts felt out of tune... some people gave light criticism, but most seemed very surprised by how much they enjoyed the song. And that's when it hit me; I didnt actually like the song, I had just become so used to defending my art that I subconsciously convinced myself that I liked it. I went back through all my other albums, and I realize now that they're all awful. Every time I play guitar now, I get a lump in the back of my throat, and I cant concentrate enough to not make constant mistakes. I cant write lyrics because they're too preachy and emo. I cant play piano because my fingers aren't agile enough. I cant play drums because I dont have a good rhythm. Plus it's not even fun anymore. I'm devastated, this was the one thing I had left, and I cant do it. Everyone is expecting a new 12 song album before Janurary. I have 7 songs, and I can barely stand any of them.

So ive struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. Ever since I can remember which was as young as 2, I just remember feeling a sense of sadness that has never left me. When I was 14 I discovered my love for music, I also loved movies, and then at 15 my love for lifting weights. I would schedule my day around those three things and they would each relieve my depression for a little while doing them. But, I'm now 26. I'm almost $20,000 in credit card debt. My career has not worked out, I have applied to over a thousand jobs and had less than 10 interviews with no offers. I'm mentally drained with scrambling every month. I live in LA. But the main problem I'm facing is Me. I feel like I almost see too much. I can't be happy. It's like I see behind the curtain of life. I'm too \"aware\"  Idk if that makes sense. I see people running around and doing all these things and I think, what for? How could any of that make you happy in the grand scheme of things?... I had a rough rough child hood. I've been in and out of relationships constantly for the last 11 years. My last one being extremely emotionally abusive towards me which has not helped. Throughout my entire life I have had people always go after me and shit on me seemingly for no reason most of the time. I am a very shy introverted person but when they start going after me I of course speak up and stand up for myself which only makes them dislike me even more and gives them a reason to now. I used to give myself pep talks and tell myself that I was being overly sensitive and just back up until I would see people that I knew who were there and they would tell me \"wow, you really get shit on a lot huh?\" I would have girlfriends tell me \"a lot of bad things happen to you\" All of these things of course just reinforcing in my mind when I already thought in the first place. I don't find enjoyment in anything anymore. Music. Movies. Working out. Even sex. And im a full blown sex addict basically.  I feel absolutely nothing. My favorite part of the day a is sleeping. I have tried self-medicating with all kinds of herbs and online research with an incredibly vast array of supplements to no avail.  There doesn't seem to be a way out of my misery and I'm drawing to a close I feel. I am just so tired and want to have either some small happiness or, rest.

This week, I was getting prepared for having a kidney stone remove, which just as fun as it sounds and leaves you in bed recovery for a week. And meanwhile, I\u2019ve been diagnosed with a GI viral infection, which has left me unable to eat (I can\u2019t keep any food down, even the blandest.). Yesterday all I had was ginger ale, slowly slowly slipped over a long period of time.today I\u2019ve eaten some applesauce. So there\u2019s some stability growing, even though I still feel awful. Had to cancel the kidney stone surgery because I haven\u2019t eaten normal food in 48 hours.

It's been taking longer and longer for me to snap back.  Recently it took me about 4 or 5 times in the span of a few days to finally calm down and regain control.  I guess masturbation has always been a problem for me.  \n\nA real turning point though must have been the first time I sent a pic.  I was 16, using kik and started chatting with a 16 year-old-girl.  Or so they said.  It was most likely just some nasty old guy pretending so he could get pics of teens.  They convinced me to take a pic probably by saying they'd return the favor.  Didn't show my face of course, but they never responded after I sent it.  After that, it was like it unlocked something in me and I did it more and more.  \n\nAt first, only from users who said they were girls my age.  I was dumb and didn't think much about possible catfishes.  Eventually, I stopped caring about who as long as they complimented me.  It made me feel good and suddenly masturbation wasn't just about me.  However, back then I would change personalities pretty much, and whenever I finished, I would instantly regret what I did and tell myself to never do it again.  It was easy to say that after I just finished, but a week later and I would get the same urges.  The voice telling me not to do it suddenly became a soft, whimpering advice.\n\nOnce I went to college and got my first girlfriend, I stopped that.  I even told her about part of that past.  Fast forward almost a year later and the relationship is over.  Some months after that and I was back to it.  I even managed to sleep with a other girl I met on the app although I didn't enjoy it.  A couple more years go by and I even allow a guy I hardly knew online over to my dorm and we gave each other hj. I didn't like it.  Once it finished, I blocked him and swore to never do that again.  I even deleted all the porn from my laptop, phone, and cloud.  Not to mention all the bookmarks in my browser.  Took hours to delete over 13gb and 8000 gifs, pics, and videos of all kinds if porn.  Also forgot to mention my porn fetishes had gotten bad and I was scared of how much worse it would get if I didn't stop.  For once in my life, I was clean and felt great.\n\nI just accidentally deleted a whole 3 paragraphs and don't feel like typing it all up again.  Short version: Depression got bad and went to group counseling sessions and learned to be more honest with people.  Tried online dating and it was horrible and my depression was at an all time high.  Started adding bookmarks back in browser but still resisted to keep porn saved on phone for more than a day.  Started making a VERY suicidal bio and although most girls only wanted to see if they could get a swipe from some like me, a girl did talk with me.  We met irl twice and talked for several hours.  Still couldn't romantically feel anything, but I rushed and tried forcing a connection, so we slept together after meeting the second time.  I didn't enjoy it.  Still wasn't emotionally or physically attracted to her romantically.  Still felt a little better though.  Brain having a hard time thinking of the more recent events, so I'll stop talking about them.\n\nRecently, depression has gotten a lot worse and I would force myself to masturbate because I would feel a little better.  However, I am now fully back into camming and I don't snap back from the personality as quickly as I used to.\n\nI've never told anyone this and am sure this will come up in therapy.  My original point in posting this has shifted part way through.", "created_utc": "2019-12-14T07:59:32+00:00", "retrieved_on": "2019-12-14T07:59:33+00:00", "subreddit": "depression", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "subreddit_type": "public", "domain": "self.depression", "gildings": {}, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/eah2sh/slightly_concerned_about_my_overbearing_lust/"}
